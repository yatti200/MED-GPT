Derangements of the primary\norgan of the circulation cannot exist without producing so great\ndisorder of the functions of that and of other parts, as to be\nsufficiently conspicuous by external signs; but, as these somewhat\nresemble the symptoms of different complaints, especially of asthma,\nphthisis pulmonalis, and water in the thorax, it has happened, that\neach of these has been sometimes confounded with the former[1]. The\nobject of the following statement of cases is to shew, that, whatever\nresemblance there may be in the symptoms of the first, when taken\nseparately, to those of the latter diseases, the mode of connection\nand degree of those symptoms at least is quite dissimilar; and that\nthere are also symptoms, peculiar to organic diseases of the heart,\nsufficiently characteristic to distinguish them from other complaints.\n\n    [Footnote 1: A careful examination of the works of some of\n    the most eminent English practical writers does not afford\n    evidence of any clear distinction of these diseases of the\n    heart. Dr. Cullen, whose authority is of the highest\n    estimation, evidently enumerates symptoms of them in his\n    definition and description of the hydrothorax. In \u00a7 1702 Th.\n    and Pr. he places much confidence on a particular sign of\n    water in the chest, and remarks, that the same sign is not\n    produced by the presence of pus. Now, there is no sufficient\n    reason, why this symptom should not arise from the presence\n    of pus, as well as from that of water; but it probably can\n    depend on neither of those alone.

Corvisart, professor in the\n    hospital of La Charite, at Paris, from whose clinical\n    lectures is derived the most important information.]\n\n\n                                CASE I.\n\nThe symptoms of organic disease of the heart are marked with\nextraordinary clearness in the following case. The opportunity for\nobserving them was very favourable; and there was every incitement to\nclose observation, which could arise from the important and\ninteresting character of the patient. These advantages will justify an\nuncommon minuteness in the detail of the case; especially, as the most\naccurate knowledge of a complaint is obtained from a successive view\nof its stages.\n\nThe late Governour of this commonwealth was endowed with most vigorous\npowers of mind and body. At the age of sixteen he was attacked with\nfits of epilepsy, which first arose from a sudden fright, received on\nawaking from sleep in a field, and beholding a large snake erecting\nits head over him. As he advanced in life they became more frequent,\nand were excited by derangement of the functions of the stomach, often\nby affections of the mind, by dreams, and even by the sight of the\nreptile which first produced the convulsions.\n\nAt the commencement of the American revolution he became deeply\nengaged in public affairs; and from that time devoted himself to\nintense application to business, with which the preservation of his\nhealth was never allowed to interfere. In the expedition against Rhode\nIsland, an attack of inflammation of the lungs had nearly proved fatal\nto him.\n\nIn the beginning of the year 1807, he suffered severely from the\nepidemic catarrh; and a remarkable irregularity of the pulse was then\nperceived to be permanent, though there is some reason to believe,\nthat this irregularity had previously existed, during the fits of\nepilepsy, and for a few days after them. In the summer, while he was\napparently in good health, the circulation in the right arm was\nsuddenly and totally suspended; yet, without loss of motion or\nsensation. This affection lasted from noon till midnight, when it as\nsuddenly ceased, and the circulation was restored. In the autumn he\nwas again seized with the influenza, which continued about three\nweeks, leaving a troublesome cough of two or three months\u2019 duration,\nand a slight occasional difficulty of breathing, which at that time\nwas not thought worth attention. Soon after, in November, he had one\nor two singular attacks of catarrhal affection of the mucous membrane\nof the lungs, which commenced with a sense of suffocation, succeeded\nby cough and an expectoration of cream coloured mucus, to the quantity\nof a quart in an hour, with coldness of the extremities, lividity of\nthe countenance, and a deathlike moisture over the whole body. These\nattacks lasted six or eight hours, were relieved by emetics, and\ndisappeared, without leaving a trace behind.\n\nAt this time he began to complain of palpitations of the heart; yet,\nit", "doc_id": "959713ed-c74c-4ac4-bf38-4aeeb46b63cc", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "390e535c7e735b6ac765f14365d3e78595aeacc7d8aef64644e5618b0ee0f991", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 4800, "end": 8379}, "relationships": {"1": "c114b069-9039-4a2c-ab6f-3bd5254fa4cc", "2": "f64a4d95-5f70-43d0-83bc-53c2697fe616", "3": "cfaed4d3-84a0-4840-bf4d-cadb560d4904"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfaed4d3-84a0-4840-bf4d-cadb560d4904": {"__data__": {"text": "of two or three months\u2019 duration,\nand a slight occasional difficulty of breathing, which at that time\nwas not thought worth attention.

These\nattacks lasted six or eight hours, were relieved by emetics, and\ndisappeared, without leaving a trace behind.\n\nAt this time he began to complain of palpitations of the heart; yet,\nit is probable, that he had been affected with these before, since he\nwas unaccustomed to mention any complaint, which was not sufficiently\ndistressing to require relief. He experienced a difficulty of\nrespiring, as he ascended the stairs, and became remarkably\nsusceptible of colds, from slight changes of clothing, moisture of the\nfeet, or a current of cold air. His sleep was unquiet in the night,\nand attended with very profuse perspiration; and, in the latter part\nof the day, a troublesome heaviness occurred. The sanguiferous vessels\nunderwent an extraordinary increase, or, at least, became remarkably\nevident. The pulsation of the carotid arteries was uncommonly strong;\nthe radial arteries seemed ready to burst from their sheaths; the\nveins, especially the jugulars, in which there was often a pulsatory\nmotion, were every where turgid with blood. The countenance was high\ncoloured, and commonly exhibited the appearance of great health; but,\nwhen he was indisposed from catarrh, this florid red changed to a\nlivid colour; which also, after an attack of epilepsy, was observable\nfor two or three days on the face and hands. This livid hue was often\nattended, under the latter circumstances, with something like\necchymosis over the face, at first formidable in its aspect, and\ngradually subsiding, till it had the general appearance of an\neruption, which also soon vanished.\n\nThese symptoms increased, almost imperceptibly, during the five first\nmonths of the year 1808. Much of this time was passed in close\napplication to official duties; and it seemed that a constant and\nregular occupation of the mind had the effect of obviating the\noccurrence of any paroxysm of disease, as well of epilepsy, as of\ndifficult respiration; and that a very sudden and disagreeable\nimpression generally produced either one or the other. There were,\nindeed, independently of such circumstances, some occasional\naggravations of those symptoms. Some nights, for example, were passed\nin sitting up in bed, under a fit of asthma, as it was called;\nsometimes the mind became uncommonly impatient and irritable; the body\ngradually emaciated; yet the appetite and digestive functions remained\nprincipally unimpaired; and persons around were not sensible of any\nmaterial alteration in the condition of the patient.\n\nOn the approach of warm weather, in June, the violence of the symptoms\nincreased. Paroxysms of dyspn\u0153a occurred more frequently, and were\nmore distressing. They commenced with symptoms of slight febrile\naffection, such as hot skin, hard, frequent, and more irregular pulse,\ndisordered tongue, loss of appetite, and derangement of the digestive\nfunctions. This kind of paroxysm lasted two or three days. Evacuations\nof blood from the nose and h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels, which before rarely\noccurred, became frequent; a fulness at the upper and right side of\nthe abdomen was sometimes perceptible, formed apparently by temporary\nenlargement of the liver; the difficulty in ascending an", "doc_id": "cfaed4d3-84a0-4840-bf4d-cadb560d4904", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "be011663c7a030cbc068dd0c4c0251468a42749e99a55168f7d892ab6694edcd", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 8269, "end": 11948}, "relationships": {"1": "c114b069-9039-4a2c-ab6f-3bd5254fa4cc", "2": "959713ed-c74c-4ac4-bf38-4aeeb46b63cc", "3": "9d0d6f89-7ea4-4c8f-89e7-684144d71817"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d0d6f89-7ea4-4c8f-89e7-684144d71817": {"__data__": {"text": "of the patient.\n\nOn the approach of warm weather, in June, the violence of the symptoms\nincreased.

This kind of paroxysm lasted two or three days. Evacuations\nof blood from the nose and h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels, which before rarely\noccurred, became frequent; a fulness at the upper and right side of\nthe abdomen was sometimes perceptible, formed apparently by temporary\nenlargement of the liver; the difficulty in ascending an eminence\nincreased sensibly. In the intervals of these attacks, which were\nvariable, but generally continuing ten or twelve days, the strength\nwas frequently good, and accompanied by a great flow of spirits, and\nan aptitude, or rather ardour, for business.\n\nSuch was the course of this complaint until the latter part of August,\nwhen a very severe paroxysm occurred. It commenced, like the former,\nwith febrile symptoms, but those more violent than before. The\ncountenance became high coloured; the dyspn\u0153a excessive, and rendered\nalmost suffocating by a slight movement, or attempt to speak; the\npulse hard, very irregular, intermittent, and vibrating; and the\ndigestive functions were suspended. These symptoms soon increased to\nthe highest degree. The respiration was so distressing, as to produce\na wish for speedy death; the eyes became wild and staring. No sleep\ncould be obtained; for, after dosing a short time, he started up in\nviolent agitation, with the idea of having suffered a convulsion.\nDuring the few moments of forgetfulness, the respiration was sometimes\nquick and irregular, sometimes slow, and frequently suspended for the\nspace of twenty five, and even so long as fifty seconds. At the end of\nthree days the febrile heat was less permanent; the red colour of the\nface changed to a death like purple; the hands and face were cold, and\ncovered with an adhesive moisture; the hardness of the pulse\ndiminished, and a degree of insensibility took place. I seized this\nopportunity to examine the region of the heart, which had not been\ndone before, from fear of alarming the active and irritable mind of\nthe patient. The heart was perceived palpitating, obscurely, about the\n7th and 8th ribs; its movements were very irregular, and consisted in\none full stroke, followed by two or three indistinct strokes, and\nsometimes by an intermission, corresponding with the pulse at each\nwrist. The pulsation was felt more distinctly in the epigastric\nregion. During this paroxysm a recumbent posture was very uneasy, and\nthe patient uniformly preferred sitting in a chair. When the recumbent\nposture was assumed, the head was much raised, inclined to the right\nside, and supported by the hand; the knees were drawn up as much as\npossible. He could not bear an horizontal posture; nor did he ever\nlie on the left side, except a short time after the application of a\nblister. At the end of the fifth day his sufferings abated, but the\nsudden affusion of a small portion of a cold liquid on the head\nproduced a severe fit of epilepsy. This was followed by a return of\nthe symptoms equally distressing, and more durable, than in the first\nattack[2].\n\n    [Footnote 2: During this time it was thought adviseable to\n    acquaint his friends, that an organic disease of the heart\n    existed, which doubtless consisted in an ossification of the\n    semilunar valves of the aorta, attended, perhaps, by\n    enlargement of the heart; that the disease was beyond the\n    reach of art, and would prove fatal", "doc_id": "9d0d6f89-7ea4-4c8f-89e7-684144d71817", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f1a069eb8eacb748f42ab0eda3e66639c36f434af4c85f2f022695c97b2fd826", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 11945, "end": 15644}, "relationships": {"1": "c114b069-9039-4a2c-ab6f-3bd5254fa4cc", "2": "cfaed4d3-84a0-4840-bf4d-cadb560d4904", "3": "84549340-c4af-490a-9044-968ef89de2c2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "84549340-c4af-490a-9044-968ef89de2c2": {"__data__": {"text": "left side, except a short time after the application of a\nblister.

The natural functions resumed their ordinary course;\nhis appetite returned; his enjoyment of social intercourse was\nunusually great; and he amused and instructed his friends by the\nimmense treasures of information, which his talents and observations\nhad afforded him, and which, he seemed to feel, would soon be lost. At\nthe end of September the feet began to swell, and after some time the\nenlargement extended up to the legs and thighs, and increased to an\nextraordinary degree; the abdomen next swelled, and, after it, the\nface. Toward the end of October there were some indications of water\nin the chest; there was a constant shortness and difficulty of\nbreathing; the cough, till now rare, became more frequent and\ntroublesome; the contraction of the thoracic cavity rendered the\naction of the heart more painful, to that beside an uniform stricture\nacross the breast, he sometimes described a dreadful sensation like\ntwisting of the organs in the thorax. He suspected the existence of\nwater there, and was inclined to consider it as his primary disease,\nbut was easily convinced of the contrary. At one time he had a\nsuspicion of a complaint of the heart, and, although he had never\nheard of a disease of that organ, slightly intimated it to one of his\nfriends, and mentioned a sensation he had experienced in the chest,\nwhich he compared to a fluid driven through an orifice too narrow for\nit to pass freely. In this month, beside the dropsical affections and\nincrease of cough, he had occasional painful enlargements of the\nliver, frequent starting up from sleep, a slight degree of dizziness,\na great disposition for reveries, and sometimes extraordinary\nillusions, one of which was, that he was two individuals, each of whom\nwas dying of a different disease. This idea often occurred, and gave\nhim much uneasiness. He was also afflicted with long continued\nfrightful dreams, and sometimes a slight delirium.\n\nAfter the use of much medicine, on the 6th of November, the effused\nfluids began to be absorbed, and passed out through the urinary organs\nwith such rapidity, that on the 12th the dropsical enlargements had\nnearly disappeared. The pulse was much reduced, in hardness and\nfrequency, by the medicine, and, as it fell, he became more easy. On\nthe 10th the state legislature convened, and the call of business\nroused, like magic, the vigor of his mind; and the symptoms of his\ndisease almost disappeared.

During this session he made little\ncomplaint, dictated many important communications, and attended to all\nthe duties of his office, without neglecting the most minute. As soon\nas the legislature adjourned, he declared, that his work was finished,\nand that he had no desire to remain longer in this world. He entreated\nthat no farther means should be used to prolong his existence, and\nimmediately yielded himself to the grasp of disease, which appeared\nwaiting with impatience to inflict its agonies.\n\nFrom this moment the distressing difficulty of breathing had very\nslight remissions. The consequent disposition to incline the superior\npart of the body forward, for the purpose of facilitating respiration,\nincreased so much, that he frequently slept with his head reposed on\nhis knees. The cough became occasionally very violent, and was always\nattended with an expectoration of a brown coloured mucus, sometimes\ntinged with blood. The abdominal viscera lost their activity. The face\nwas sometimes turgid and high coloured, at other times pallid and\ncontracted. A gradual abolition of the powers of the mind ensued, with\na low delirium, and two short fits of phrenzy. The state of the\ncirculation was very variable; the pulse at the wrists principally\nhard and vibrating, rarely soft and compressible; the less pulsations\nbecoming more indistinct, and at length scarcely perceptible. No\nperfectly distinct beat of the heart was felt, but a quick undulating\nmotion, not corresponding with the pulse at the wrist. Three days\nbefore death the arteries assumed this undulatory motion, corresponded\nwith the motion of the heart, and, for forty-eight hours, lost the\nirregularity of pulsation[3].\n\n    [Footnote 3: The celebrated Morgagni has recorded some cases\n    of organic disease of the heart discovered by dissection, the\n    symptoms of which do not exactly accord with those observed\n    in this and the succeeding cases. It should be remembered,\n    however, that many of the subjects of those cases were not\n    examined by him, while living, and others but a very short\n    time before death.

The\nhands were slightly \u0153dematous. Discolourations, answering to the\nribs, were observed on the thorax; many small purple spots, hard and\nprominent, on the back; excoriations on the nates; and purple spots,\nresembling incipient mortification, on the heel and toe.\n\n\n                                THORAX.\n\nThe integuments of the thorax were free from fat: the cartilages of\nthe ribs ossified in various degrees, some perfectly, others slightly.\nUpon laying open the cavity of the thorax, it was found to contain\nabout three pints of water, the proportion being greatest on the left\nside.\n\nThe lungs were contracted into a smaller compass than usual, and were\nvery firm to the touch. Their colour anteriorly was whitish, with\nsmall distinct purple spots; posteriorly, of a deep red, with similar\nspots. The right lobe adhered closely to the pericardium; it also\nadhered to the pleura costalis, by a great number of strong cords,\nwhich seemed to be elongations of the original adhesions. Some of them\nwere nearly as hard as ligament, and many an inch in length.\nInternally the lungs presented a very compact structure.

The auricles and ventricles contained coagulated blood. The\ntricuspid valves were in a sound state. The left auricle was double\nthe usual size. The left ventricle was enlarged, about three times\nthicker and much firmer than usual. The mitral valves were very much\nthickened, and near the insertion of their column\u00e6, which were sound,\ncartilaginous, so that they were quite rigid, and the opening made by\nthem, from the auricle to the ventricle, was scarcely large enough to\nadmit the passage of a finger. The semilunar valves of the aorta were\nossified at their bases and apices, and the portion intermediate,\nbetween the base and apex, partly ossified, and partly cartilaginous,\nso as to render the valves very rigid. The aorta was at least one half\nlarger than usual, especially at its arch. The arteria innominata, the\ncarotid, and subclavian arteries, were uncommonly large and thick.

The liver was shrunk; its tunic\ncorrugated, as if it had been distended, and bearing marks of\ninflammation; its substance harder than usual; its vessels, when\ndivided, pouring out liquid black blood. The gall bladder was filled\nwith bile. The kidneys were thicker, and more irregular in form, than\nis common. The abdominal cavity contained some water.\n\n\n                                 HEAD.\n\nThe bones of the cranium were unusually thick. The dura mater, which\nwas thickened, and in many places bore marks of former inflammation,\nadhered to the bone at the vertex. On its internal surface, near the\nlongitudinal sinus, there was a small ossified portion, half an inch\nlong and the eighth of an inch thick. The convolutions of the brain\nwere narrow, and very strongly marked. The pia mater bore marks of\npretty extensive inflammation, and adhered to the dura mater at the\nvertex. The cortical substance ran deep into the medullary part of\nthe brain. The ventricles contained about double the usual quantity of\nwater; their parts were all remarkably well defined.

D.\n\nMY DEAR SIR,\n\nYour important communication to our society, which is about to be\npublished, will lay before the American public much more knowledge\nrespecting the diseases of the heart, and large vessels, than has\nhitherto been presented to them. A case has lately fallen under my\nobservation, having so much similarity to those of organic diseases of\nthe heart, which have occurred to you, as to mark its affinity, yet\nwith some differences, which characterize it as a variety. If the\nstatement of it will add any value to your collection of cases, you\nare at liberty to publish it.\n\nA. S. twenty-eight years of age, and of middle stature, was attacked,\nafter a debauch, with pain in the region of the heart, which subsided,\nbut returned a year after on a similar occasion. He then became\naffected with palpitations of the heart for six months, great\ndifficulty of breathing, which was augmented by ascending an eminence,\nsevere cough, dizziness, and violent head-ache, attended by a\ndisposition to bend the body forward, and sudden startings from sleep.\nHis pulse was always regular, and never remarkably hard. His\ncountenance, till within a few weeks of death, presented the\nappearance of blooming health. His feet and legs did not swell at any\nperiod of the disease. He suffered exceedingly from flatulence, to\nwhich he was disposed to attribute all his complaints. This symptom\nmight have been aggravated by his habits of free living, and\noccasional intoxication, which he acknowledged, and to which he traced\nthe origin of his disease.\n\nAfter death, water was discovered in the thorax; but the lungs had not\nthat appearance of accumulation of blood, in particular spots, which\nis commonly observed in cases of organic disease of the heart. The\nonly very remarkable morbid appearance about the heart was in the\naorta, and its valves. The valves had lost their transparency, and\nwere considerably thickened in various spots. The inner surface of\nthe aorta, for about an inch from its commencement, was elevated and\nthickened, and the external surface singularly roughened and\nverrucated. This appearance was so peculiar, that no words will give a\ncompetent idea of it, and perhaps it would be sufficient for me to\ncall it a chronic inflammation[10].\n\n                              I am, my dear sir,\n                                  Your friend and obedient servant,\n                                                         JAMES JACKSON.\n\n    [Footnote 10: See plate second.]\n\n\n                              CASE VIII.\n\nCol.

William Scollay, aged fifty-two, of a plethoric habit of body,\nwas attacked, in the year 1805, with dyspn\u0153a and palpitation of the\nheart, attended with irregularity of the pulse, and \u0153dema of the\nlower extremities. By the aid of medicine, the dropsical collections\nwere absorbed, and he recovered his health, so far as to follow his\nusual occupations, nearly a year; but was then compelled to relinquish\nthem. The symptoms afterwards underwent various aggravations and\nremissions, till the beginning of the winter of 1808-9, when the\nattacks became so violent, as to confine him to the house. His face\nwas then high coloured. The faculties of his mind were much impaired.\nThe dyspn\u0153a became more constant, and was occasionally attended by\ncough; the palpitations rather lessened in violence; the pulse was\nmore irregular, and exceedingly intermittent. The abdomen and inferior\nextremities were sometimes enormously distended with water, and\nafterwards subsided nearly to their usual size. One of the earliest,\nmost frequent, and distressing symptoms, was an intense pain in the\nhead. About two months before death, a hemiplegia took place, but\nafter a few days disappeared. This so much impaired the operations of\nthe mind, that the patient afterwards found great difficulty in\nrecollecting words sufficient to form an intelligible sentence. During\nthe existence of the last symptom the pulse was regular.\n\nHe gradually expired, on the 15th of March, 1809.\n\n\n                  DISSECTION, FIVE HOURS AFTER DEATH.\n\n\n                         EXTERNAL APPEARANCE.\n\nThe countenance was somewhat livid and pale; the lips were very livid.\nThe chest resounded, when struck, except over the heart. The abdomen\nwas tumid, and marked by cicatrices like those of women, who have\nborne children. The superior extremities were emaciated, and marked\nlike the abdomen.

The lungs, externally, were dark coloured, especially the\nposterior lobes; internally, they were very firm, and, in some places,\nas dense as the substance of the liver. A frothy mucus was effused\nfrom them in great quantities. They were coloured by very dark blood,\nespecially in the middle portion of the left superior lobe. One or two\ncalcareous concretions were observed in them.

The dyspn\u0153a is not yet very\ndistressing, except on using motion; it often occurs in the night, and\nobliges her to rise and sit up in bed.

Being a man of an active\nmind, he had read some medical books, whence he got an idea, that he\nwas hypochondriac.\n\nOn examining his pulse, it was found to be occasionally intermittent,\ncontracted, and vibrating. He had some years previously been attacked\nwith copious h\u00e6morrhages from the stomach or lungs, which have\noccasionally recurred, though they have lately been less frequent.\nEight years since he suffered from an inflammation of the lungs; and\nabout two or three years ago he first experienced a beating in the\nchest, and pain in the region of the heart, which increased till\nwithin six or eight months, since which the beating has been\nstationary, and the pain has much increased. In the course of the last\nsummer, dyspn\u0153a, on using exercise, and especially ascending any\neminence, commenced. This has greatly increased, so as to render it\nalmost impossible for him to go up stairs. His countenance is turgid,\nand uniformly suffused with blood; his eyes are bright and animated;\nhis lips livid. The pulsation of the heart cannot be felt on the left\nside, and is barely perceptible on the right side of the sternum, and\nin the epigastric region. When he is distressed with fits of dyspn\u0153a,\nhe feels something as if rising to the upper part of the thorax, and\nthe heart then seems to him to be beating through the ribs. I have not\nwitnessed any of these paroxysms. The inferior extremities and abdomen\nhave been swelled about three weeks. When in bed, he has his head and\nshoulders elevated, and, upon the attack of his paroxysms, sits up and\ninclines his head forward; but he keeps from the bed as much as\npossible. In his sleep he is apt to start up, suddenly, in distress,\nespecially when he first slumbers. His dreams are often frightful,\nand, when awake, he is affected with reveries, during which, though\nconscious of being awake, strange illusions present themselves. At\nintervals he seems slightly delirious. He has a violent cough, with\nvery copious expectoration of thick mucus. He often suffers from\nsevere head-ache, and the least exercise produces dizziness.\n\nThis man has a very robust frame of body, and has been accustomed to a\nfree use of ardent spirits, and of opium, of which he now takes about\ntwelve grains in a day. His appearance is such, that, on a slight\nsurvey, one would not suppose him diseased, but, on observing him with\na little attention, a shortness and labour of respiration are\nperceived, with some interruption in speaking, and a frequent catching\nof the breath, or sighing.\n\nApril.

Since writing the above account, the dropsical collections were\nabsorbed, and the palpitations and other symptoms moderated, so that\nhe considered himself nearly well, and attended to his usual business.\nWithin a few days, however, the symptoms have returned with more\nviolence. The dyspn\u0153a is at times very distressing; the pulse more\nirregular and intermittent; the palpitations are more constant. His\nsufferings from lying in bed are so increased, that in the most\ncomfortable nights he passes, he sits up once in an hour or two. The\nappetite is keen. The legs begin to swell again.\n\nSome organic disease of the heart exists in this case. The\nindistinctness of the palpitations, the want of hardness in the pulse,\nand the slow progress of the disease, indicate a loss of power in the\nheart, the effect of the distention and thinness of its parietes.

It is attended with a sensation of\nuniversal distress, which perhaps may arise from the circulation of\nunoxygenated blood, or the accumulation of carbon in the system; for\nthe countenance becomes livid, and the skin, especially that of the\nextremities, receives a permanent dark colour. This dyspn\u0153a soon\ncauses distress in lying in an horizontal posture. The patient raises\nhis head in bed, gradually adding one pillow after another, till he\ncan rarely, in some cases never, lie down without danger of\nsuffocation; he inclines his head and breast forward, and supports\nhimself upon an attendant, or a bench placed before him. A few hours\nbefore death the muscular power is no longer capable of maintaining\nhim in that posture, and he sinks backward. The dyspn\u0153a is attended\nwith cough, sometimes through the whole of the disease, sometimes only\nat intervals. The cough varies in frequency. It is always strong, and\ncommonly attended with copious expectoration of thick mucus, which, as\nthe disease advances, becomes brown coloured, and often tinged with\nblood; a short time before death it frequently consists entirely of\nblack blood.\n\nThe changes in the ph\u0153nomena of the circulation are very remarkable.\nThe sanguiferous system is increased in capacity; the veins,\nespecially, are swelled with blood; the countenance is high coloured,\nexcept in fits of dyspn\u0153a, when it becomes livid; and it is very\nfrequently puffed, or turgid. The brightness of the eyes, dizziness,\nwhich is a common, and head-ache, which is a frequent symptom, and in\nsome cases very distressing, are probably connected with these\nchanges. The motions of the heart, as has already been stated, are\ninordinate, irregular, and tumultuous. The pulse presents many\npeculiarities. In some cases, probably where there is no obstruction\nin the orifices of the heart, it remains tolerably regular, and is\neither hard, full, quick, vibrating and variable, or soft, slow,\ncompressible and variable. Most commonly, perhaps always, when the\norifices of the heart are obstructed, it is vibrating, very irregular,\nvery intermittent, sometimes contracted and almost imperceptible, very\nvariable, often disagreeing with the pulsations of the heart, and\nsometimes differing in one of the wrists from the other.\n\nThe functions of the brain suffer much disturbance. Melancholy, and a\ndisposition for reverie, attend the early stages of the complaint; and\nthere is sometimes an uncommon irritability of mind. The dreams become\nfrightful, and are interrupted by sudden starting up in terror.\nStrange illusions present themselves. The mental faculties are\nimpaired.

The termination of the disease is attended with slight\ndelirium; sometimes with phrenzy, and with hemiplegia.\n\nThe abdominal viscera are locally, as well as generally, affected.\nAlthough the digestive functions are occasionally deranged, the\nappetite is at some periods remarkably keen. The action of the\nintestines is sometimes regular, but a state of costiveness is\ncommon. The liver is often enlarged, probably from accumulation of\nblood. This distention is attended with pain, varies much, and, in all\nthe cases I have seen, has subsided before death, leaving the coats of\nthe liver wrinkled, flaccid, and marked with appearances of\ninflammation, caused by the distention and pressure against the\nsurrounding parts. An effect of the accumulation of blood in the\nliver, and consequently in the mesenteric veins, is the frequent\ndischarge of blood from the h\u00e6morrhoidal vessels. This occurs both in\nthe early and late stages of the disease, and may become a formidable\nsymptom. Evacuations of blood from the nose are not uncommon.\n\nDropsical swellings in various parts of the body succeed the symptoms\nalready enumerated. They commence in the cellular membrane of the\nfeet, and gradually extend up the legs and thighs; thence to the\nabdominal cavity, to the thorax, sometimes to the pericardium, to the\nface and superior extremities; and, lastly, to the ventricles and\nmeninges of the brain. These collections of water may be reabsorbed by\nthe aid of medicine; but they always return and attend, in some\ndegree, the patient\u2019s death.\n\nThere is no circumstance more remarkable in the course of this\ncomplaint, than the alternations of ease and distress. At one time the\npatient suffers the severest agonies, assumes the most ghastly\nappearance, and is apparently on the verge of death; in a day or a\nweek after, his pain leaves him, his appetite and cheerfulness\nreturn, a degree of vigour is restored, and his friends forget that he\nhas been ill. The paroxysms occasionally recur, and become more\nfrequent, as the disease progresses. Afterwards the intermissions are\nshorter, and a close succession of paroxysms begins. If the progress\nof the complaint has been slow, and regular, the patient sinks into a\nstate of torpor, and dies without suffering great distress. If, on the\ncontrary, its progress has been rapid, the dyspn\u0153a becomes excessive;\nthe pain and stricture about the pr\u00e6cordia are insupportable; a\nfurious delirium sometimes succeeds; and the patient expires in\nterrible agony.\n\nSuch are the symptoms, which a limited experience has enabled me to\nwitness.

Some may think, that there is no\nessential difference in the symptoms of these diseases. The\nresemblance between them, however, is merely nominal.\n\nThe cough in hydrothorax, unlike that which attends organic diseases\nof the heart, is short and dry; the dyspn\u0153a constant, and not subject\nto violent aggravations. An uneasiness in a horizontal posture attends\nit, but no disposition to incurvate the body forward. These are some\nof the points, in which these two diseases slightly resemble each\nother. Those, in which they totally differ, are still more numerous;\nbut as most of them have been already mentioned, it is unnecessary to\nindicate them here.\n\nIt is probable, that the two diseases commonly arise in patients of\nopposite physical constitutions; the hydrothorax in subjects of a weak\nrelaxed fibre; the organic diseases of the heart in a rigid and robust\nhabit. The subjects of the latter affection, in the cases which have\nfallen under my observation, were, with the exception of one or two\ninstances, persons of ample frame, and vigorous muscularity, and who\nhad previously enjoyed good health. In nearly all these cases the\ncollection of water was principally on one side, yet the patients\ncould lie as easily on the side where there was least fluid, as on the\nother; which, in the opinion of most authors, is not the case in\nprimary hydrothorax. It should also be observed, that, in many of the\ncases, there was only a small quantity of water in the chest, and that\nin neither of them was there probably sufficient to produce death. May\nnot primary hydrothorax be much less frequent, than has commonly been\nimagined?\n\nIdiopathic dropsy of the pericardium may, perhaps, produce some\nsymptoms similar to those of organic disease of the heart; but it\nappears to be an uncommon disorder, and I have had no opportunity of\nobserving it. In the fourth case, a remarkable disposition to syncope,\non movement, distinguished the latter periods of the disease, and\nmight have arisen from the great collection of water in the\npericardial sac.\n\nThe causes of this disease may, probably, be whatever violently\nincreases the actions of the heart. Such causes are very numerous; and\nit is therefore not surprising, that organic diseases of the heart\nshould be quite frequent. Violent and long continued exercise, great\nanxiety and agitation of mind[14], excessive debauch, and the habitual\nuse of highly stimulating liquors, are among them.\n\n    [Footnote 14: It has been remarked by the French physicians,\n    and particularly by M.

A careful attention to the symptoms will enable us\nto distinguish the disease, in its early stages, in which we may\nundoubtedly combat it with frequent success.\n\nAlthough it may not admit of cure, the painful symptoms attending it\nmay be very much palliated; and, as they are so severely distressing,\nwe ought to resort to every probable means of alleviating them.\nRemedies, which lessen the action of the heart, seem to be most\ncommonly indicated. Blood-letting affords more speedy and compleat\nrelief, than any other remedy. Its effect is quite temporary, but\nthere can be no objection to repeating it. The digitalis purpurea\nseems to be a medicine well adapted to the alleviation of the\nsymptoms, not only by diminishing the impetus of the heart, but by\nlessening the quantity of circulating fluids. Its use is important in\nremoving the dropsical collections; and for this purpose it may often\nbe conjoined with quicksilver. Expectoration is probably promoted by\nthe scilla maritima, which, in a few cases, seemed also to alleviate\nthe cough and dyspn\u0153a. Blisters often diminish the severe pain in the\nregion of the heart, and the uneasiness about the liver. It has been\nseen, that the excessive action of the heart sometimes produces\ninflammation of the pleura and pericardium, and that the distention of\nthe coat of the liver has the same effect upon that membrane in a\nslighter degree. Vesication may probably lessen those inflammations.\nWhen the stomach and bowels are overloaded, a singular alleviation of\nthe symptoms may be produced by cathartics, and even when that is not\nthe case, the frequent use of moderate purgative medicines is\nadvantageous. Full doses of opium are, at times, necessary through the\ncourse of the complaint. The antiphlogistic regimen should be\ncarefully observed. The food should be simple, and taken in small\nquantities, stimulating liquors cautiously avoided, and the repose of\nbody and mind preserved, as much as possible.\n\nThe causes of some of the ph\u0153nomena of this disease are easily\ndiscovered; those of the others are involved in obscurity, and form a\nvery curious subject for investigation.

I was informed, however, that they increased\nin violence, especially the difficulty of breathing, and inability to\nlie down; that her cough returned, and her expectoration was sometimes\nbloody; and that, for sometime before death she suffered inexpressible\ndistress.\n\nWe found the body somewhat emaciated, and the lower extremities and\nleft arm \u0153dematous. Might not this swelling of the left arm have\ndepended on her constant posture of inclining to her left side?\n\nThe face, especially at the lips, was livid, though not so much as in\nmany other cases of this disease. On the left shoulder were small,\nhard, and prominent livid spots.\n\nThe cellular membrane, both on the outside and inside of the thorax,\nwas quite bloody, which is not usually the case in dead bodies. The\ncartilages of the ribs were slightly ossified, and, upon their\nremoval, it appeared that the pericardium and its contents occupied an\nextraordinary space, for the lungs were quite concealed by them. These\norgans being drawn forward, appeared sound and free from adhesions;\ntheir colour, anteriorly, was rather dark; posteriorly, still darker;\ntheir consistence firm. Their vessels were so crowded with blood, as\nto cause an uniform dark colour in the substance of the lungs,\nespecially in some particular spots, where the blood appeared to be\naccumulated; but whether this accumulation was confined to the blood\nvessels, or extended to the bronchial vesicles, could not be\nsatisfactorily determined. No one can doubt that blood may be\nfrequently forced through the thin membrane of the air vesicles, who\nconsiders, that in these cases the heart often acts with uncommon\nviolence, that, when it is enlarged, it attempts to send toward the\nlungs more blood than their vessels can contain, and that there is\ncommonly some obstruction to the return of blood from the lungs into\nthe heart, from derangement either in the mitral or aortal valves, or\nin the aorta. The consequent accumulation of blood in the lungs seems\nto me to be the probable cause of the dyspn\u0153a, which so much\ndistresses those affected with diseases of the heart; for if there be\nan inordinate quantity of blood, there must be a deficiency of air.\n\nThis accumulation of blood in the lungs has, by some writers, been\nconsidered as an appearance belonging to idiopathic hydrothorax.\nWhether it ever exists in that complaint seems to me", "doc_id": "44e01732-7cff-4ce7-b74b-0600195c2c66", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "24877f59a776e55506b6bd0adb91abf675fcd4c33962abdf136d4f8343796cb3", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 76436, "end": 79905}, "relationships": {"1": "c114b069-9039-4a2c-ab6f-3bd5254fa4cc", "2": "ff22bec9-a9ab-45ed-b562-c7563eb94bf6", "3": "0fff38c5-b1f7-4c41-8041-0318663b6495"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fff38c5-b1f7-4c41-8041-0318663b6495": {"__data__": {"text": "enlarged, it attempts to send toward the\nlungs more blood than their vessels can contain, and that there is\ncommonly some obstruction to the return of blood from the lungs into\nthe heart, from derangement either in the mitral or aortal valves, or\nin the aorta.

The\npressure of water upon the lungs, may possibly interrupt the free\ncirculation of blood through their vessels, yet probably the same\npressure would prevent the entrance of blood into the vessels, unless\nthere be some other cause to overcome it, such as increased action of\nthe heart, which attends only the first stage of hydrothorax. It has\nbeside been proved by the experiments of Bichat, that the collapsion\nof the lungs does not obstruct the circulation of blood through the\npulmonary vessels. It seems probable, therefore, that those who have\nthought this collection of blood an appearance belonging to idiopathic\nhydrothorax, have mistaken for it the secondary hydrothorax produced\nby diseases of the heart.\n\nOn pursuing the examination, we found, behind the lungs, about five or\nsix ounces of yellowish serum in each cavity of the pleura, and about\none ounce in the cavity of the pericardium. The heart was then seen\nenlarged to more than double its natural size. Its surface, especially\nalong the course of the branches of the coronary arteries, was\nwhitened by coagulated lymph. In the cavities of the heart, which were\nall enlarged and thickened, particularly the left, were found portions\nof coagulum mixed with fluid blood. Near its apex, over the left\nventricle, was a small soft spot which, to the finger, seemed like the\npoint of an abscess ready to burst. The tricuspid valves, and the\nvalves of the pulmonary artery, had lost somewhat of their\ntransparency, and were a little thickened, though not materially. It\nis worthy of remark, that these valves have not exhibited any great\nappearance of disease in any of these cases, while those of the left\nside of the heart have scarcely ever been found healthy. So it\nappeared in this case. The mitral valves were uniformly thickened, and\npartly cartilaginous; the left portion adhered to the side of the\nheart. The valves of the aorta had lost their usual form, were\nentirely cartilaginous, and almost equal in firmness to the aorta,\nwhich was cartilaginous under the valves, sound in other parts, and\nrather small, compared to the size of the heart.\n\nIt may be thought that the symptoms, on which reliance was placed to\ndistinguish disorder of the valves of the aorta, are fallacious,\nbecause it was supposed that these valves would be found ossified,\nwhen they were in reality only cartilaginous. The difference, however,\nwould be small in the effects produced on the circulation by such a\nstate of the valves as existed in this case, and a very considerable\nossification; for, if the valves were rigid and unyielding, it is of\nlittle importance whether they were rendered so by bone, or cartilage.\nWhether the irregularity of the pulse in these diseases generally\ndepends on the disorganized state of the aortal, or other valves, we\nhave not at present observations sufficient to decide.

He became weaker,\nhad more straitness and pain about the heart on moving, an increase of\nswelling in the legs and abdomen, return of the cough, and a pain from\nthe left shoulder to the middle of the arm. After his relapse in\nApril, he had been directed to employ blisters, the submuriate of\nquicksilver, and the tincture of the digitalis purpurea. The dose of\nthe tincture he gradually increased, till he took two hundred drops,\ntwo or three times in a day. Notwithstanding a profuse flow of urine,\nthe legs became so hard and painful, that I made punctures to\ndischarge the water from them. He would have had the water in the\nabdomen drawn off, but believing it would not afford him great relief,\nI dissuaded him from it. On the 10th of May, after having passed an\nunusually comfortable night, he rose and left his chamber for five or\nsix hours, then retiring to it again, said he would be tapped that\nday, and, after lying down, was quitted by his attendant, who went in\nan hour after and found him dead.

This was rather unexpected, for he\nhad the appearance of sufficient vigour to struggle with disease three\nor four weeks longer.\n\nA number of medical gentlemen being assembled, as has been usual on\nthese occasions, we first remarked, that the face was swollen, and\nextraordinarily livid; for, although a considerable degree of\nlividity, and sometimes of redness, after death, is peculiar to these\ncases, we had seen none which resembled this. Hard and prominent\npurple spots were observed upon the shoulders, side, and back. The\nsurface of the body was moderately covered with fat; the legs and\nabdomen were much swollen with water, the arms more slightly. The\ninteguments of the thorax being cut through, the cellular membrane\ndischarged a serous fluid from every part; these being turned aside,\nto lay bare the cartilages of the ribs, we found them completely\nossified; and having divided them, with a saw, the cavity of the\nthorax was opened. The cellular membrane, inside the thorax, about the\nmediastinum, had not so bloody an appearance as we witnessed in the\npreceding cases, nor were the lungs, either externally or internally,\nso dark coloured as usual, though they were much darker, firmer, and\nmore filled with blood, than is common in subjects of other diseases.\nThe lungs of the left side adhered closely to the pleura costalis, and\nthose of the right were tied by loose and membranous adhesions; beside\nwhich there was no appearance of disease about them. The cavity of the\npleura did not contain any water; that of the pericardium held about\nsix ounces.\n\nThe anterior surface of the heart exhibited a considerable whiteness\nof its coat over the coronary arteries. This appearance differed from\nthat of other cases, in being contained in the substance of the\nmembrane, instead of lying on its surface; and, either from this\ncircumstance, or from the length of time since it had existed, its\naspect was so peculiar that it might be supposed to be the first stage\nof an ossification. A deposition of lymph on the heart has been\nobserved in every one of these cases of organic disease, and it has\nexisted principally over the branches of the coronary arteries, or\nelse near the apex of the heart, which is to be attributed to the\nirritation of the membrane by the combined impulse of the heart and\ncoronary arteries, and to the stroke of the apex upon the ribs. This\nis an appearance that, as it belongs to this complaint, might be\nuseful in a case otherwise dubious, if any such should occur, to aid\nin deciding whether the action of the heart had been inordinate.\n\nThe heart was enlarged to double its usual size, as we judged with\nconfidence, for pains had been taken to examine hearts in a healthy\nstate, for the purpose of forming a comparison. Its firmness was not\nproportioned to its bulk, but it was considerably flaccid. Near the\napex, over the left ventricle, was a soft spot, similar to that found\nin the preceding case.

This therefore\nmust be considered as another appearance peculiar to this complaint,\nbecause it is well known, that blood is not usually found in the left\ncavities of the hearts of those who die of other disorders. The cause\nof it is doubtless an obstruction, which opposes the free discharge of\nblood from the heart, whether that obstruction be in the aortal\nvalves, in the aorta itself, or in the disproportion between the\nheart, or more precisely the left ventricle, and the parts it supplies\nwith blood.\n\nWhy was the blood entirely fluid in this case? If we compare the\nappearance of the cellular membrane, and of the lungs, in both of\nwhich there was a deficiency of blood, with the aspect of the face,\nwhere there was an accumulation of blood, and consider at the same\ntime the mode of termination of this case, we shall find reason to\nbelieve, that death was produced by a violent pressure of the brain\nfrom a congestion of blood in its vessels, in consequence of the\nobstruction to the return of that fluid to the heart. An additional\nproof of this opinion is derived from the great quantity of blood,\nwhich poured from the vena cava superior, during the whole time of the\nexamination, and afterward; so that it was found impossible to\npreserve the subject from the blood flowing between the ligatures,\nnotwithstanding the thorax was entirely emptied, before it was closed.\nIn cases of sudden death from apoplexy, related by Morgagni, the blood\nwas frequently fluid, and this may be supposed to be the cause of that\nappearance in the present case. The extraordinary thinness or watery\nstate of the blood is a distinct circumstance, which will be presently\nnoticed.\n\nAn examination of the brain, to ascertain the truth of the supposition\nabove mentioned, was relinquished with regret, but this was\nimpracticable; for the want of time on these occasions frequently\nobliged us to content ourselves with investigating the state of the\nmost important parts. This must serve as our apology for not oftener\nrelating the appearance of all the principal organs; yet it should be\nobserved, that such methods have been employed to ascertain with\naccuracy the most interesting morbid ph\u0153nomena, as would satisfy the\nmost scrupulous anatomist.\n\nThe tricuspid valves and the semilunar valves of the pulmonary artery\nhad lost their healthy transparency, but were not otherwise diseased.\nIn all the above cases these valves had been found without important\nderangement of their structure; a circumstance not less remarkable,\nthan difficult to be satisfactorily explained. The basis of the mitral\nvalves was marked by a bony projection, which nearly surrounded the\norifice of the ventricle; the valves themselves were thickened, and\none of them was smaller than the other. The semilunar valves of the\naorta were lessened in size, and somewhat thickened. One of them was\nossified sufficiently to annihilate its valvular function; the others\nwere slightly.

The aorta under the valves was semicartilaginous,\nossified in one small spot, roughened by fleshlike prominences in\nothers, entirely deprived of the smoothness of its internal coat, and\nin size proportioned to the heart.\n\nThe parietes of the heart were thicker than those of a healthy heart,\nbut thin when compared with its whole volume; whence it follows, that\nthe cavities were enlarged. That of the left ventricle was\ndisproportionately larger than the others, but no difference of size\ncould be ascertained between the auricles. When a cavity of the heart\nis situated in the course of the circulation immediately behind a\ncontracted orifice, it seems probable that the contraction may have an\nimportant influence in originating the enlargement or aneurism of that\ncavity; but, where there is no contraction of an orifice, what is the\nobstruction which impedes the free discharge of blood from the heart,\nand causes the first yielding of its parietes? Perhaps a violent\nsimultaneous action of many muscles, from great exertion, may, during\nthe systole of the heart, impede the passage of the blood through the\narteries, drive it back upon the valves of the aorta, and resist the\nheart at the moment of its contraction. If the parietes of the heart\nyield, in one part, it is easy to conceive a consequent distension of\nthe remainder to any degree; for, during the systole of the heart, the\ncolumn\u00e6 approximate, till their sides are in contact, to protect the\nparietes of the heart; but, if these be distended, the column\u00e6 can no\nlonger come in contact with each other, and the blood passing between\nthem will be propelled against the parieties, and increase their\ndistention. The left ventricle being thus dilated, the mitral valves\nwill not be able to completely cover its orifice, and part of the\nblood will escape from the ventricle, when it contracts, into the\nauricle when dilated with the blood from the lungs; and this undue\nquantity of blood will gradually enlarge the auricle. A resistance\nwill arise, from the same cause, to the passage of the blood from the\nlungs, thence to that from the right ventricle and auricle, and thus\nthese cavities may become enlarged in their turns. When an\nossification of the aorta, or of its valves, exists, there will be a\nresistance to the passage of the blood from the left ventricle, either\nby a loss of dilatability in the artery, or a contraction of the\norifice by the ossified parts. In either case, the blood will reflow\nupon the heart, and dilate the left ventricle, as in _case the first_,\nand others; and, if the mitral valves be thickened and rigid, the left\nauricle will be more dilated than in a case of simple aneurism of the\nleft ventricle, as appeared also in the _first case_.\n\nThe coronary arteries, at their origin from the aorta, and a\nconsiderable distance beyond, were ossified.

The vestiges of inflammation in the coat of the\nliver were traced in every instance already related, while at the same\ntime the liver, in all, appeared shrunken. The diminution of size in\nthe liver, after death, cannot at present be well explained; for it is\nvery certain that such a diminution is not an attendant of this\ndisorder, during most of its stages, but that on the contrary a state\nexists precisely opposed to it. The indications of distention of the\nliver, clearly perceived in some cases, have been pain, tenderness,\nand sense of distention, in the right hypochondrium, and, what is less\nequivocal than these, very considerable swelling and prominence of the\nliver. The inflammation of its tunic is an effect of this distention\nand of the consequent pressure against the adjacent parts.\n\nThe cause of this ph\u0153nomenon can easily be explained. If an\nobstruction exist in either side of the heart, or in the lungs, the\nblood to be poured into the right auricle, from the vena cava\ninferior, must be obstructed, its flow into that vessel from the liver\nwill be equally checked, the thin coats of the hepatic veins and of\nthe branches of the vena porta will yield and distend the soft\nsubstance of the liver. Hence are caused the discharges of blood from\nthe h\u00e6morrhoidal veins, which form one of the characteristic symptoms\nof the disease; for as these vessels empty their blood into the\nmeseraic veins, which open into the vena porta, if the meseraic veins\nbe obstructed, the h\u00e6morrhoidals must consequently be also affected,\nand they easily burst open from too great distention. The h\u00e6moptoe,\nwhich also is so frequent, is as easily explained on the same\nprinciple.\n\nThe cause of the serous collections is not so readily discovered. In\nthis case, as in most of the others, we found a considerable quantity\nof water in the abdominal cavity. Dropsy is commonly considered as a\ndisease of debility, but in these cases it often appeared, while the\nstrength was unimpaired, and the heart acted with very extraordinary\nforce. If the blood was driven with rapidity through the arteries,\nwhile an obstruction existed at the termination of the venous system\nin the heart, the consequences must have been accumulation in the\nvenous system, difficult transmission of the blood from the extreme\narteries to the veins, overcharge of the arterial capillary system,\nconsequent excitement of the exhalant system to carry off the serous\npart of the blood, for which it is adapted, and thence a serous\ndischarge into the cavities, and also on the surface of the body; for\ngreat disposition to sweating is a common symptom. In addition to\nthese, there is another cause of the universality of these effusions.\nThe blood, in all the cases which I have examined, is both before and\nafter death, more thin and watery than healthy blood.

Perhaps, as the imperfect respiration must cause a\ndeficiency of air, and consequently of oxygen, in the lungs; and as\nthe absorption of oxygen is a cause of solidity in many bodies, this\ntenuity of the blood may proceed from a deficient absorption of\noxygen. However this may be, it is certain that the blood is very much\nattenuated, though with considerable variations in degree, as it is\nsometimes found thin on opening a vein, and at a subsequent period is\nthicker; varying perhaps according to the continuance of ease or\ndifficulty in respiration. It is certain, that this attenuation of the\nblood must tend to an increase of the serous exhalations.\n\nThat these secondary dropsies are not the effect of debility appears\npretty evident from considering, that they often exist while the\nstrength of the patient is yet undiminished, while all the other\nsecretions, except that of the urine, are carried on with vigour, and\nwhile the appetite and digestive functions are not only unimpaired,\nbut improved.\n\nThe examinations of the _ninth_ and _tenth cases_ are particularly\nvaluable, because they confirm what had been observed in other\nsubjects; they exhibit two well marked instances of aneurism of the\nheart, and present us a view of organic disease unattended by dropsy\nof the pleura. This must be sufficient to remove the suspicion, that\nthe symptoms we have attributed to the former disease might arise from\nthe existence of the latter. No one probably will be willing to impute\na chronic disease, terminated by a sudden death, to five or six ounces\nof water in the pericardium; for such a quantity, though it might\nproduce inconvenience, could not prove fatal, unless it were suddenly\neffused; and, if this were true, it of course could not have been the\ncause of the long train of symptoms observed in _case tenth_.\n\nDr. William Hamilton, the author of a valuable treatise on the\ndigitalis purpurea, thinks the hydrothorax a more frequent disease\nthan has commonly been imagined, because he conceives that it has\noften been mistaken for organic disease of the heart. He names, with\nsome precision, many symptoms of the latter complaint; but how remote\nhe is from an accurate knowledge of it may be discovered by his\nopinion, that, in diseases of the heart, \u201cthe patient can lie down\nwith ease, and seldom experiences much difficulty of breathing.\u201d The\nlimits of this paper do not admit a discussion of this and other\npoints, respecting which he seems to be mistaken.

In proof of this, reference may be had to\nDr. Warren, sen. who has a number of cases, and also to Dr. Dexter,\nDr. Jackson, and Dr. J. C. Howard.\n\nA lady from the country, of a robust habit, whose age is about\nthirty-four years, complains of uneasiness in the right side below the\nedge of the ribs, sometimes attended with swelling, external soreness,\nand a throbbing pain, which often reaches to the shoulder, and\nproduces a numbness of the right arm. She is rather uncertain at what\ntime her complaints commenced. About two years since she lost her\nhusband, and was left with but small means to support a number of\nchildren. She became in consequence, much dejected. While nursing a\nchild, about a year since, she first was sensible of palpitations of\nthe heart, which, in about three months, were followed by dyspn\u0153a\nvery much augmented by ascending an eminence; and profuse discharges\nof blood from the mouth, first raised, she believes, by vomiting, and\nafterwards by coughing. Evacuations of blood from the h\u00e6morrhoidal\nvessels appeared about the same time, and occasionally since, till\nwithin six weeks, during which time there have been no sanguineous\ndischarges, and this suppression has aggravated her other complaints.\n\nThe pulsation of the heart is felt most distinctly quite on the left\nside of the thorax, where there is a painful spot; it is perceptible\nalso in the epigastric region. It is irregular and variable, at one\nmoment hard, strong, distinct, and vibrating; at another, feeble and\nconfused. There is also sometimes perceived a pulsation above the left\nclavicle, within the insertion of the mastoid muscle, commonly\nattended with a visible fulness of the superior part of the breast.\nThe thorax feels, to the patient, as if it were girt across, and there\nis a distinct pain in the heart. Both these sensations are aggravated\nby a very hard, frequent, and dry cough, which however begins to be\nless violent from the use of the scilla maritima.

She is subject to profuse sweatings, and very liable to\ntake cold, and is then more uneasy.\n\nThis lady is still corpulent. She has taken much medicine, under the\ndirection of eminent physicians, sometimes with temporary relief, but\nmost commonly without any. The exercise of walking slowly, in\npleasant weather, although it increases the palpitations at the\nmoment, is followed with relief from the distressing feelings, which\nare increased when she sits still for a long time. She has no\nsuspicion of her hopeless situation, and confidently expects relief\nfrom medicine, yet labours under a melancholy which is unnatural to\nher.\n\n\n                         CASE OF HYDROTHORAX.\n\n     The following case of hydrothorax will shew, that water may\n     exist in the chest without the symptoms, which we have\n     attributed to organic diseases of the heart.\n\nMrs. T----, aged 56 years, of an excessively corpulent habit, had been\naffected for a great number of years with a scirrhus of the right\nbreast. Finding her health decline, she at last disclosed it, and in\ncoincidence with the opinion of Dr. WARREN, sen. I amputated it on the\n30th of May, of the present year. We however informed her friends,\nthat the probability of eradicating the disease was extremely small.\nThe skin was in many places hardened and drawn in, and in others\ndiscoloured, and ulcerated at the nipple, so that it was found\nnecessary to remove, not only what covered the breast, but some\nportion of that which surrounded it. A long chain of diseased glands,\nextending quite to the axillary vessels, was also extirpated. She bore\nthe operation well, lost no great quantity of blood, and recovered her\nappetite and strength surprisingly in a few days, while the wound\nhealed rapidly. At the end of twenty days a difficulty of breathing\ncommenced, and soon became so oppressive, that she could no longer lie\nin bed; partly, no doubt, on account of her extraordinary obesity. The\npulse was small, quick, and commonly feeble, but sometimes a little\nhard, when any degree of fever was", "doc_id": "f0f84836-f0d0-4deb-b7d1-a9a2be16e1d6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ce5d172cbad0fb8464cf12e18ac01ff8b4a9d79b832f3af6ef21ea458b78fa48", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 109517, "end": 113127}, "relationships": {"1": "c114b069-9039-4a2c-ab6f-3bd5254fa4cc", "2": "36071c89-5da8-4b71-9d9c-0e1b249c26e0", "3": "6654542e-5efe-4799-8c69-527b4028fff1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6654542e-5efe-4799-8c69-527b4028fff1": {"__data__": {"text": "in others\ndiscoloured, and ulcerated at the nipple, so that it was found\nnecessary to remove, not only what covered the breast, but some\nportion of that which surrounded it.

At the end of twenty days a difficulty of breathing\ncommenced, and soon became so oppressive, that she could no longer lie\nin bed; partly, no doubt, on account of her extraordinary obesity. The\npulse was small, quick, and commonly feeble, but sometimes a little\nhard, when any degree of fever was present. The countenance became\npale, the lips of a leaden hue, the eyes dim. We were surprised at the\nchange, and conjectured that the cancerous action had suddenly\nextended to the lungs. Yet she had not the slightest cough; and it was\nremarked by Dr. WARREN, sen. that he had never observed that diseased\naction to increase, while the wound remained open. At last the lower\nextremities swelled, which might be attributed to the upright posture,\nand the pressure on the absorbent vessels in that posture. The\nappetite failed; she complained of a constant sense of depression at\nthe stomach, and, without any remission of the difficulty of\nbreathing, died on the 1st of July.\n\nOn the next morning the body was examined. The pleura in both cavities\nof the thorax was studded with small, white, and apparently\nhomogeneous tubercles; the lungs contained a great number of similar\nbodies. The right cavity of the pleura was entirely filled with water,\nof which we removed at least three quarts. The heart was of the usual\nsize, very flaccid and tender; but not otherwise disordered. The liver\nwas enlarged, of its usual colour, much hardened, and had on its\nsurface, and in its substance, many tubercles like those in the\nthorax. It had also a great number of encysted cavities, each about\nthe size of a hazle nut, which contained a thin yellow fluid. The gall\nbladder was wanting, and in its place there was a small, but very\nremarkable depression, without a vestige of any former gall bladder,\nfor the coat of the liver was as smooth and perfect there as in any\nother part[15]. The pancreas was in a scirrhous state. The abdomen did\nnot contain any water.\n\n    [Footnote 15: See Soemmerring de corporis humani fabrica,\n    vol. 6, pag. 188 and Baillie\u2019s morbid anatomy, pag. 248.]\n\nIt seems, then, that water may exist in the cavity of the thorax,\nwithout any remarkable symptoms, except dyspn\u0153a and difficulty in\nassuming the horizontal posture. But in organic diseases of the heart,\nthere is a long train of frightful symptoms, distinguishable by the\nmost superficial observers. We infer that these disorders have been\nunnecessarily confounded.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Cases of Organic Diseases of the Heart, by \nJohn Collins Warren\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HEART DISEASE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 26836-0.txt or 26836-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/6/8/3/26836/\n\nProduced by Bryan Ness, Irma Spehar and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This\nbook was produced from scanned images of public domain\nmaterial from the Google Print project.)\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the", "doc_id": "6654542e-5efe-4799-8c69-527b4028fff1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "efe6119b27e4b077a2f95692d5735a9c4317d5a13e8838d3b01a4913907d245a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 113122, "end": 116646}, "relationships": {"1": "c114b069-9039-4a2c-ab6f-3bd5254fa4cc", "2": "f0f84836-f0d0-4deb-b7d1-a9a2be16e1d6", "3": "95742b59-286f-4c62-b4da-6457bf9d6acc"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "95742b59-286f-4c62-b4da-6457bf9d6acc": {"__data__": {"text": "confounded.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Cases of Organic Diseases of the Heart, by \nJohn Collins Warren\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HEART DISEASE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 26836-0.txt or 26836-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/6/8/3/26836/\n\nProduced by Bryan Ness, Irma Spehar and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This\nbook was produced from scanned images of public domain\nmaterial from the Google Print project.)\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.

PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN,--My first duty this evening is to\nthank you, which I do most heartily and gratefully, for the\nhonour you have done me by selecting me to deliver the Lettsomian\nLectures for the present year. My second duty is to spend as little\ntime as possible on preliminary remarks, for--as you, Sir, know,\nhaving yourself occupied this distinguished place on a former\noccasion--three hours are all too brief for useful presentation of\nmaterial which one has collected for a purpose like the present. In\nselecting the subject of my Lectures I was mindful of the character\nand objects of this Society. In the Medical Society of London there\nis a fuller blending of men engaged in family practice with men\nholding hospital appointments than is the case at most of the other\nlearned societies connected with our profession in London; and\nthere is here an opportunity for free communication of experience\nand interchange of opinion between these two classes of our Fellows\nwhich cannot fail to be profitable to both. Therefore, I have taken\nup a subject of thoroughly practical interest; and not only this,\nbut I will attempt to present it to you, to put you in a position\nto look at it, from the point of view of the practitioner. The\nproblem of the diseases and disorders of the heart and arteries\nin middle and advanced life may be said to come before the family\npractitioner every hour of his work, and to offer difficulties and\ncreate a sense of responsibility or even anxiety which are not\nsufficiently appreciated by the hospital physician. There comes\nbefore him the case of one of his patients, an active business\nman of 45, who has been seized with angina pectoris when hurrying\nto the station after breakfast, or that of an old friend, whose\nproposal for an increase of his insurance at 50 has been declined\nbecause of arterial degeneration and polyuria; or he is asked to\nsay whether a man of 60, occupying an important and possibly\ndistinguished position in the community, ought to retire from public\nlife because he has occasional attacks of pr\u00e6cordial oppression\nand a systolic murmur at the base of his heart. What, again, is he\nto do for the stout, free-living man, just passing the meridian of\nlife, who consults him for weakness and depression, whose heart is\nlarge and feeble, and the urine saccharine and slightly albuminous?\nThere is not one of my audience who has not met with such cases as\nthese many times in his practice, and a variety of other cases of\ncardiac disorder and disease after 40, where the importance of the\nindividuals, the value of their", "doc_id": "eac56751-f25c-4311-8eda-1a3a16a0f63e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "59a2a371905c244a3a19872466ea547a36b2d04f72019f5edbc905a0ed9aa009", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3954, "end": 7115}, "relationships": {"1": "7a9e63ce-6a97-4dd0-8895-ffacc479e9df", "2": "825302d6-7f86-4ae2-bf32-79f487e27353", "3": "d54a7670-f855-433e-8e78-36bdd765eaf0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d54a7670-f855-433e-8e78-36bdd765eaf0": {"__data__": {"text": "declined\nbecause of arterial degeneration and polyuria; or he is asked to\nsay whether a man of 60, occupying an important and possibly\ndistinguished position in the community, ought to retire from public\nlife because he has occasional attacks of pr\u00e6cordial oppression\nand a systolic murmur at the base of his heart. What, again, is he\nto do for the stout, free-living man, just passing the meridian of\nlife, who consults him for weakness and depression, whose heart is\nlarge and feeble, and the urine saccharine and slightly albuminous?\nThere is not one of my audience who has not met with such cases as\nthese many times in his practice, and a variety of other cases of\ncardiac disorder and disease after 40, where the importance of the\nindividuals, the value of their lives, and the gravity of their\ncomplaints and their prospects have exercised him very anxiously.\nWhat is the prognosis in cases of this order? What can be done for\nthem in the way of treatment? These are the questions which we\nwould desire to answer usefully. The answer, it seems to me, can be\ngiven only after an analysis and study of a considerable number of\ninstances of the kind, in respect of their origin, their clinical\ncharacters and course, and the result. This is the method of inquiry\nwhich I propose to follow. It will be a study of cardio-vascular\ndisease in older subjects from the clinical point of view, and it\nwill be approached not only from the ordinary clinical side as\nit is approached in hospitals, that is, by an investigation of\nsymptoms and signs, but also and especially in the light of that\nparticular order of knowledge which the family practitioner has\nlearned to appreciate and has so intimate an opportunity to acquire\ncorrectly--a knowledge of the origin or causes of the different\naffections, which it is always difficult, and often impossible, for\nthe hospital physician to ascertain. For the same reason, although,\nto be complete, a study of the diseases of the circulation at and\nafter middle life should include an account of the _post-mortem_\ncharacters found in fatal cases, and whilst the basis of the\naccount I submit to you will be essentially pathological, I shall\nnot attempt to describe the pathological anatomy and histology of\nthis group of lesions of the heart and arteries. This part of the\nsubject has been remarkably advanced during the last few years;\nand even if I had the time and the necessary knowledge to deal\nwith it now, I should have nothing original in it to lay before\nyou. Indeed, if I may venture to say so, our attention lately has\nbeen too much confined to the pathological states of the heart and\narteries and too little directed to the causes which produce them.\n\"Arterial sclerosis\" is now an ordinary diagnosis in every-day\npractice, as if it were sufficient for purposes of prognosis and\ntreatment to have determined that the radial artery is thicker and\nlonger and more dense than normal, without regard to the actual\nnature of the pathological change, whether strain, or syphilitic,\nor gouty, or otherwise. And in the same way the phrase \"dilatation\nof the heart\" is now in everybody's mouth, irrespective of\nconsiderations of its origin. Not only has the profession suddenly\nwoke up to the recognition of a form of enlargement of the heart\nwhich was fully described fifty years ago by physicians in our own\ncountry, but the public have made \"dilated heart\" a fashionable\ndisease which calls for the advice of a specialist and an annual\nvisit to a Continental spa. We ought to have advanced beyond this\nstage of cardiac pathology long before this time. Besides, of how\nmuch greater interest is it in our every-day work to study the\ncauses or circumstances that lead up to disease than the simple\nstate of disease itself!

And there is in a study of this kind\nan opportunity afforded to the family practitioner of advancing\nMedicine--scientific, preventive and therapeutical--as surely as if\nhe were a pathologist in the _post-mortem_ room or laboratory.\n\nBefore, however, examining the influences and circumstances which\ndisorder and damage the circulation in middle and advanced life, let\nus see what the normal or natural state of the heart and arteries\nis after 40. It has been ascertained that the different parts of\nthe circulatory apparatus pass through certain definite phases\nof change in the different stages of that decline of existence\nand energy which leads to senility and ends in death. We have to\nthank Professor Beneke, of Marburg, for the results of a laborious\ninvestigation of this subject which are generally accepted and which\nI will attempt to summarise.[1]\n\n  [1] F. W. Beneke, 'Die Altersdisposition.'\n\nWe should all expect the cardio-vascular system to undergo important\nchanges with increasing age; but few of us would be prepared to\nfind that these changes are neither uniformly progressive nor\nindeed continuously progressive in the same direction. To make\nmore easily intelligible the nature and as far as possible the\norigin of these anatomical alterations in the heart and arteries\nduring the second half of life, I will first refer for a moment\nto the circulation from 20 to 45. During this period of life the\nblood-pressure is relatively high, reaching its maximum about 36;\nthe aorta and other large arteries increase in diameter from the\nstress of the blood-pressure on their elastic walls, particularly\nbetween 35 and 45, and the heart increases in size year after year\nat a nearly uniform rate. We have in these facts anatomical evidence\nof the great functional vigour and activity of the circulation in\nmanhood. At 45, which is practically the commencement of the period\nwith which we are concerned, remarkable changes occur. Whilst the\narteries continue to increase in circumference (somewhat more slowly\nthan before), the blood-pressure falls and the heart begins--almost\nsuddenly--to diminish in size; and these three features characterise\nthe circulation for the next 20 years, that is, until the age of\n65. How is this fall in the size of the heart to be accounted for?\nPartly by the widening of the arterial trunks and the consequent\nfall of pressure. But not by these only; for although the arteries\nhad been widening even more rapidly between 20 and 45, the pressure\nwas actually at its maximum then and the heart large, and we shall\npresently find other facts opposed to this view. The peripheral\nresistance in the systemic arteries must fall from some other cause\nor causes in middle age than the loss of elasticity of the arterial\nwalls, and these causes are probably reduction of mechanical stress,\ndue to comparative bodily relaxation, loss of vaso-motor tone in the\nsplanchnic area, and the chronic diseases of which the subjects have\ndied whose hearts and vessels are measured _post mortem_.

The\ndecline of circulatory energy, and the effects of time itself\non the protoplasm of the cells of the body, have so lowered the\nmetabolic and functional energy of the tissues and organs and the\nactivity of the blood-supply, that a considerable proportion of the\ncapillary network becomes obsolete. The peripheral resistance is\nthus increased, and the blood-pressure rises; therefore the heart\nonce more increases so much in size that at the end of the 10 years\n(age 75) it is found as large as it was at 45, and at the same\ntime the h\u00e6moglobin value of the blood again proves to be higher.\nDuring this period, also, the arteries continue to grow wider and\nthicker and longer--another proof that the size of the heart is\nnot determined solely by their calibre. Regarded as a whole, the\nprocess of senescence of the cardio-vascular system presents to us a\nbeautiful instance of anatomical readjustment and compensation--the\ncounterpart, in a way, of the growth of the circulation in energy\nand activity during the period of full manhood. The arterial walls,\nwhich have been stretched in their diameter and in their length by\nexhaustion of their elasticity under the stress of cardiac systole,\nare strengthened afresh by the development of stays formed of\nfibroid and muscular tissues in the intima and media; and the heart\nresponds to the altered mechanical condition ahead of it in the\narteries, and to the increased peripheral resistance caused by the\nobsolescence of many capillaries, by growing afresh.\n\nThis account relates to the size of the arteries after 40; now let\nus inquire what is the condition of their structural elements. The\nchanges described do not necessarily involve disease of the tissue\nelements, unless we were to call every senile change morbid. My\nfriends Dr. Bosanquet and Dr. Mullings have given me an account of\nthe state of the heart and aorta in the bodies of 25 men, aged 40\nand upwards, examined in the _post-mortem_ room of Charing Cross\nHospital, who had died from accident or suicide. The average age\nwas 53\u00bd years, and the aorta presented some degree of atheroma\nin half the cases. When we consider how very slight a change in the\narch of the aorta is habitually described as \"atheroma,\" and that in\na few of the cases the valves were diseased and the heart enlarged,\nwe are justified in concluding that in the majority of persons of\n53 the arteries are still sound. This result is in accord with that\nobtained by the late Professor Humphry, who devoted his attention so\nlong and so successfully to the investigation of old age. He states\nthat in the great majority of cases the arterial system appears to\npresent a healthy condition in those who attain to great age.[2]\nEven among the majority of centenarians the evidences of arterial\ndegeneration were not manifest.[3] And we know that we occasionally\nmeet with people of 80 and upwards whose pulses are unexceptionable,\nbeyond presenting a trace of thickening and enlargement.\n\n  [2] Humphry, 'Old Age,' 1889, p. 23.\n\n  [3] _Op. cit._, p. 48.\n\nFor my present purpose, therefore, we may conclude that as age\nadvances, the arteries naturally become wider, longer and thicker,\nand altogether larger than in early life; and that we must not\nspeak of \"vascular", "doc_id": "ba571c18-7592-47a0-9df4-adc393e24ec1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6d9290b841284586ba79cccecb7dec07c403b3dafc0eb6e4af03cd2aacd11c1f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 14624, "end": 18424}, "relationships": {"1": "7a9e63ce-6a97-4dd0-8895-ffacc479e9df", "2": "8c039b2b-548d-47a5-a4de-2c296ccc3cf1", "3": "2579227e-7a58-4739-89b2-0e50f5bb58b0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "2579227e-7a58-4739-89b2-0e50f5bb58b0": {"__data__": {"text": "of old age.

As for the heart, we know that it\nmay remain structurally sound, and is more often regular than\nirregular, to the most advanced years of life. Conversely, these\nfacts suggest that actual diseases of the arteries and heart, that\nis, other than the changes which are found in all persons after 45,\nare not properly senile in their nature. As Professor Humphry said,\nthey are no part of, but are rather to be regarded as deviations\nfrom, or morbid departures from, the natural phenomena.[4] They\nmust be the effects of pathological processes due to a variety of\npathogenetic influences which assail the circulation. Now we are in\na position to study these.\n\n  [4] Humphry, 'Old Age,' 1889, p. 15.\n\nAfter the age of 40, many of the influences that threaten the heart\nand arteries with disorder and disease are peculiar to this period\nof life--that is, different and distinct from the causes of cardiac\nand vascular affections in childhood, adolescence and manhood;\nothers of them have been encountered already, with or without\npermanent damage as the result. I will now examine them in detail,\nand at the same time refer to certain provisions with which the\nheart and arteries are endowed for resisting them and recovering\nnaturally from their effects, as well as to the circumstances\nwhich render these provisions abortive or insufficient, and thus\npredispose to disease or indirectly determine its occurrence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n1. _Physical stress_ is still a definite cause of cardiac and\nvascular damage during the second half of life, in the forms both\nof sudden violent exertion and of ordinary laborious occupations.\nI have met with instances of acute and serious strain at all ages\nover 40, up to and even after 70. I am aware that I must speak on\nthis part of my subject--the evil effects of muscular exercise--with\ngreat caution in the presence of you, Sir, our President, who\nhave long been recognised as one of the principal patrons in our\nprofession of athletic sports, and so highly distinguished yourself\nin them at Oxford and in the inter-University contests. I assume\nthat you are unwilling to admit that muscular exercise is dangerous\nto health. But I feel sure that you will agree with me that when the\nman of 65 rushes from his breakfast-table to catch his train, or\nthe lady of 70 hurries up a hill in Wales to be in time for morning\nservice, or the middle-aged father on holiday, who has just started\na bicycle in order to reduce his weight, takes the pace from his son\nof 17, the effect on the heart and arteries is likely to be serious.\nI have notes of a good many cases of cardiac strain in middle-aged\nand old persons from cycling; a very few from violent efforts\nto drive at golf; a few from efforts at lifting or resisting\nheavy weights; and one notable case in which a member of our own\nprofession, a man of 45, belonging to the Royal Army Medical Corps,\nbroke down with acute cardiac", "doc_id": "2579227e-7a58-4739-89b2-0e50f5bb58b0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "abf161c98753de99fedb4220ec3eddf3a929e93af1acc25a18bba16260af8e5b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 18469, "end": 22173}, "relationships": {"1": "7a9e63ce-6a97-4dd0-8895-ffacc479e9df", "2": "ba571c18-7592-47a0-9df4-adc393e24ec1", "3": "8c5481cd-7f62-49f2-8680-509e3478da81"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c5481cd-7f62-49f2-8680-509e3478da81": {"__data__": {"text": "But I feel sure that you will agree with me that when the\nman of 65 rushes from his breakfast-table to catch his train, or\nthe lady of 70 hurries up a hill in Wales to be in time for morning\nservice, or the middle-aged father on holiday, who has just started\na bicycle in order to reduce his weight, takes the pace from his son\nof 17, the effect on the heart and arteries is likely to be serious.\nI have notes of a good many cases of cardiac strain in middle-aged\nand old persons from cycling; a very few from violent efforts\nto drive at golf; a few from efforts at lifting or resisting\nheavy weights; and one notable case in which a member of our own\nprofession, a man of 45, belonging to the Royal Army Medical Corps,\nbroke down with acute cardiac dilatation during General French's\nmemorable ride to relieve Kimberley. In some of my cases there was\nno reason to believe that the heart was other than sound before the\nstrain; but in a majority of them (and I have analysed 40, of which\nI have more or less full notes) one or more of the safeguards of\nthe circulation against strain were already defective or wanting.\nWhat are these? In the heart, chiefly a high degree of extensibility\nor elasticity of its tissues, permitting over-distension of the\nchambers, with safety-valve action of the tricuspid in extreme\ncases, and a sound and vigorous musculature to effect the increased\naction, and if necessary the hypertrophy, which mechanical stress\ndemands--in a word, healthy, well-nourished cardiac walls. It is\nan interesting fact that two-thirds of my cases of cardiac strain\nin the second half of life presented also a history of gout, fully\ndeveloped or irregular--in other words, a history of perverted\nmetabolism. Equally striking is another fact in this connection:\nthat in many cases the occurrence of strain in middle or advanced\nage was but the latest of a series of similar events as the result\nof muscular effort for a period of 10, 20, 30, 40, or even 50\nyears--in other words, the heart had been strained originally in\nyouth or early manhood, and had given serious trouble as often as\nit was taxed again. Rowing or running at college was in a good many\ninstances given as the cause of the first strain. I need not do more\nthan mention previous valvular disease, usually of rheumatic origin,\nas a condition powerfully predisposing to cardiac injury by physical\nexertion. Excepting in this indirect way, rheumatism has no effect\nin lowering the resistance of heart or vessels to mechanical stress.\n\nThe principal safeguard which the arteries possess against strain\nis, of course, the extensibility and elasticity of their tissues.\nUnfortunately the metabolic disorders, including gout, which we have\njust found weakening the cardiac walls, are amongst the commonest\ncauses of arterial degeneration also; and the two influences--gout\nand strain--acting together no doubt are accountable for a\nconsiderable number of cases of atheroma and chronic arteritis. It\nnaturally might occur to us that gout and exertion could not well\nbe associated, but this very consideration serves to explain their\nmutual influence in straining the heart. It is unwise, ill-timed,\nill-planned muscular exercise that injures the circulation, most\noften on the part of the middle-aged man, who, awaking to the\nconsciousness of growing fat and gouty, rushes inconsiderately to\nviolent exercise for relief.\n\n2. It is generally recognised that nervous excitement and other\n_nervous influences_ tax the circulation; and endless phrases\nand expressions, articulate and inarticulate, testify to the\nuniversal belief in the close connection between the heart and the\nemotions.

Quite recently Dr. Leonard Hill and Dr. George Oliver\nhave demonstrated instrumentally the rise of blood-pressure that\naccompanies cerebral activity.[5] No doubt many cases of disorder\nand disease of the walls of the heart and arteries originate in\ndistress, worry, anxiety and protracted suspense; and the connection\nis most often seen in middle and advanced life, because these\ndepressing emotions fall most heavily upon mankind at this period.\nOf the instances which I have met with I will mention but one or\ntwo by way of illustration. A member of the Reform Committee at\nJohannesburg at the time of the Jameson Raid, who had been confined\nin Pretoria Jail, came home sometime afterwards with the ordinary\nsymptoms and signs of fatty degeneration of the heart, and died\nsuddenly on the street. A detective officer who had tracked suspects\nand criminals all over the world, facing great personal danger,\nand on one occasion had to convey a parcel of dynamite found\nnear a Government office to a place of safety many miles away,\ncame under my care later on with arterial sclerosis and cerebral\nthrombosis, for which no other cause but a life of adventure could\nbe discovered. These were cases of actual disease of the heart and\narterial system respectively; and I need not add that disturbances\nor disorders of the circulation, of every degree and variety, the\nresult of nervous excitement or depression, come constantly under\nour observation, especially in women. I would particularly mention,\nhowever, a group of cardio-vascular troubles that lie between these\ntwo extremes. I have frequently observed that persons of anxious\nand energetic temperament, burthened with responsible work of a\nheavy, constant and prolonged character, when they break down,\nas they often do, present the clinical features of high tension:\nthe pulse is full, the heart is large, the second aortic sound is\nloud and ringing; there is polyuria, and a trace of albumen may be\nfound. This disturbance of the circulation, strongly suggestive of\ncontracted kidney, is as common in women as in men--for instance,\nin matrons of schools or hospitals. Nevertheless, however clear\nthe direct connection between nervous strain and cardio-vascular\ndisease may be in many instances, it is in other instances unreal,\nor more correctly indirect only. This is a matter of great practical\nimportance. First, the nervous temperament often drives the subjects\nof it to physical overwork in the form of incessant and prolonged\ndevotion to work, with insufficient hours of rest and sleep, and to\nunwise attempts to remove nervous exhaustion by violent muscular\nexercise, as we have just seen. In the second place, alcohol\nundoubtedly plays an important part in many instances regarded\nas overwork and worry and nervous exhaustion, both in men and in\nwomen--alcohol taken to enable more work to be accomplished, to\nsteady the nerves, to promote sleep, to drive away care, or to\nrelieve the faintness which it has itself induced. And thirdly,\nmany of the complaints of nervous depression, lowness and worry are\nreally due to gout, to influenza, and the like, which are at the\nsame time the true causes of the cardiac symptoms.\n\n  [5] Leonard Hill, Allbutt's 'System of Me inc,' vol. xii; George\n ", "doc_id": "8bbe9558-ebf9-4275-92f2-e0a42931fa12", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "afe4cc3e1f90bb53185924186ec50cba3e3235a7cf6e2ac1a7688b115e68ac33", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 25978, "end": 29768}, "relationships": {"1": "7a9e63ce-6a97-4dd0-8895-ffacc479e9df", "2": "8c5481cd-7f62-49f2-8680-509e3478da81", "3": "2d8acf6f-30ab-47e2-8673-68b582a2b911"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d8acf6f-30ab-47e2-8673-68b582a2b911": {"__data__": {"text": "attempts to remove nervous exhaustion by violent muscular\nexercise, as we have just seen.

What I have just said in connection with nervous causes of\ncardio-vascular affections brings us naturally to that important\ngroup of agents which may be summarily called _extrinsic cardiac\npoisons_--alcohol, tobacco, tea, coffee and lead. I will not\ndwell on this subject at present, for there is no need to prove\nthe reality of the connection, and I shall have occasion to refer\nto some of these poisons at greater length under the head of\ndiagnosis. Alcoholic heart occurs both in men and women; tobacco\nheart is extraordinarily common in our own profession, and common\nin clergymen and in retired members of the public services; tea-,\ncoffee-, and cocoa- poisoning I have met with principally in\nstudents.\n\n4. There can be no question but that by far the most prolific causes\nof cardio-vascular disorder and disease after 40 are _disturbances\nof metabolism_, including gout--at any rate amongst the middle\nand upper classes in this country. This period of life brings\nwith it in many instances comparative relaxation from work, and a\ndisposition to substitute quiet or even passive for active exercise;\nand whilst the demands of growth and development on the alimentary\nsystem have greatly declined, the pleasures of the table and ease\ngenerally are too often indulged in as a privilege of advancing\nyears and the legitimate reward of previous years of work. The\nresults are functional disorders of the liver, gout in regular and\nirregular forms, gravel, and the many associated disorders of the\nmuscular, nervous and other systems. At the same time the arterial\ntension rises, for the body possesses a physiological provision for\neliminating the nitrogenous products of metabolism, whether normal\nor abnormal, namely, the kidneys, the vaso-motor mechanism and the\nheart. Stimulation of the vaso-motor centre by nitrogenous waste\nraises the arterial pressure; the heart is excited to more vigorous\ncontraction (if necessary it hypertrophies); and the consequent\npolyuria washes the intrinsic poisons out of the system. Thus it\nhappens that in metabolic disorders, from excessive or unwholesome\neating and drinking, the heart, vessels and kidneys are kept under\nincessant strain; and, like other organs working under strain in the\ngouty subject, they are the readiest to suffer--first from disorders\nof many kinds, and ultimately, unless reform be enforced, from\ncardio-vascular degeneration and chronic Bright's disease.\n\nOf the many cases of this kind that I have seen at all ages between\n40 and 80 (and others before 40), the proportion of irregular gout\nto acute articular gout was about 3 to 2. Under irregular gout\nI include goutiness in its many forms--sick headache, eczema,\nsciatica, lumbago, acid dyspepsia, irritable bladder, asthma,\ninsomnia, vertigo, depression, and the familiar complexion and\nappearance generally of \"the gouty individual,\" all variously\ncombined.\n\nIn other cases the", "doc_id": "2d8acf6f-30ab-47e2-8673-68b582a2b911", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f98832a92af7679e37df25d74c16ea0abeb8d9f05204d54af0ac80207bb2191f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 29817, "end": 33468}, "relationships": {"1": "7a9e63ce-6a97-4dd0-8895-ffacc479e9df", "2": "8bbe9558-ebf9-4275-92f2-e0a42931fa12", "3": "679713d1-7841-4a91-824a-ed9b0eb1b5e5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "679713d1-7841-4a91-824a-ed9b0eb1b5e5": {"__data__": {"text": "the\ngouty subject, they are the readiest to suffer--first from disorders\nof many kinds, and ultimately, unless reform be enforced, from\ncardio-vascular degeneration and chronic Bright's disease.\n\nOf the many cases of this kind that I have seen at all ages between\n40 and 80 (and others before 40), the proportion of irregular gout\nto acute articular gout was about 3 to 2.

Whatever the date of\nthe primary infection, syphilis is a standing danger to the heart\nand arteries in the middle-aged man and even in declining years.\nThus, in 11 cases belonging to this group, the average age at which\nthey came under my observation (most of them but not all complaining\nof cardiac distress) was 55. All of these were men. I ought to add\nthat in a considerable proportion of the cases either physical\nstrain, alcohol, tobacco or Bright's disease was associated with\nsyphilis in the etiology, and sometimes more than one of these.\n\n6. For the man and woman of forty years of age and upwards, most\nof _the acute specific fevers_ are affairs of the past. But the\nliability to several of them remains, and, very unfortunately, the\nliability to those acute specific processes which may attack the\ncardio-vascular system--influenza in particular, and less often\ntyphoid fever, rheumatism, diphtheria and pneumonia, as well as\nseptic\u00e6mia of different forms or kinds, which works havoc throughout\nthe entire circulation. I should have had more to say under this\nhead but for the fact that our distinguished Fellow and former\nPresident, Dr. Sansom, has thoroughly investigated it, and on more\nthan one occasion laid the results before you.\n\n7. I will not occupy your time this evening in tracing the\norigin of certain cases of cardio-vascular disease in middle and\nadvanced life to _chronic affections_ of different kinds. Besides\nthe obvious effects upon the heart, blood and blood-vessels, of\nan\u00e6mia, exhaustion, &c., we meet with such grave lesions as fatty\ndegeneration from pernicious an\u00e6mia and other blood disorders;\nprofound circulatory derangements and occasionally valvular lesions\nin Graves's disease, and others.\n\n8. I now pass on to _complex causes_. In addition to the definite\nand distinct influences which I have mentioned as threatening the\nheart in this stage of life, there are two which are intimately\nassociated with other causes of cardio-vascular disease, but still\ndeserve to stand out independently. The first of these is emphysema,\nand along with it other chronic affections of the lungs and pleura,\nwhich strain the right ventricle; the second is chronic Bright's\ndisease, which similarly strains the left ventricle. I shall have\nfrequent occasion to return to these two morbid states in different\nparts of my subject.

And this\nbrings me to the many instances in which the different influences\nthat threaten the circulatory organs in middle and advanced life act\ntogether in different combinations. Alcoholism is equally common\namongst the poor, whose circulation is subjected to mechanical\nstress, whilst it is impoverished by want; the well-to-do, who lead\nluxurious, sedentary enervating lives; and, as I have already\nobserved, the keen active business or professional man who overworks\nhis brain on stimulants. In this country at least, gout appears to\nbe all-pervading, and as an unfavourable influence on heart and\nvessels it often cannot be dissociated from alcohol, sedentary\nhabits, worry, plumbism, Bright's disease and emphysema.\n\nThus, in our study of combinations of morbific influences we come\nto appreciate the evil effect of certain _occupations_ upon the\ncirculation in middle life. The business man is exposed to the\nunhealthy actions on his heart of confinement to a close office\nor shop, worry, irregular hasty feeding, alcoholic indulgence in\nconnection with his trade or profession, and unwise attempts at\nviolent muscular exercise at the week-end or in the holiday season;\nor he may be guilty of entire disregard of the rules of bodily and\nmental hygiene, and bring on in this way premature degeneration of\nhis cardio-vascular system. Still more numerous are the causes at\nwork in the production of \"soldier's heart.\" We have but to picture\nto ourselves, if we can, the physical strain, the mental excitement,\nthe bodily hardships--including exposure to both extremes of\ntemperature--and the coarse fare which have been the lot of many\nthousands of our brave troops in the Boer war, to understand how the\nfighting soldier \"ages\" quickly, and, in particular, ages in his\nheart and arteries. Add to these unfavourable influences syphilis,\nalcohol and tobacco (which, unfortunately, must be added in many\ninstances), and the chance of escape from disease of the circulation\nin the soldier is practically _nil_. But \"soldier's heart\" is also\nmet with elsewhere than in the army. The clergyman from the slums\nof London or other great city, who has lived and toiled and--it may\nbe said truly--has fought with various success through alternate\nperiods of excitement and depression, and has thus suffered much\nboth in mind and body, comes to us with high-tension pulse, a\ntortuous radial artery, a large heart and a systolic murmur over\nthe aorta, and complains of an attack of angina. His wife, who has\nlaboured in the parish for years (she is 76, and still active in her\nwork of charity), has also a thickened radial artery, a large heart,\nand a systolic basic murmur, with no discoverable cause of these\nevidences of a diseased circulation but the life that she has led\namongst the poor around her.

I have given but a broad, hasty\nsketch of them entirely from my own recent observations, and I\nknow that I have omitted some which in your opinion might deserve\nmention, but which possess no special interest in relation to this\nperiod of life--for example, the agents of acute infections of\nthe endocardium, and also new growths, pregnancy and parturition.\nLet me now sum up the results, and say that whatever changes the\ncardio-vascular system may present in middle and advanced life,\nbeyond those which we have found to be natural to it at those\nparticular periods, are pathological--the result of physical stress,\nnervous influences, extrinsic poisons, disturbances of metabolism,\nsyphilis, acute disease, or chronic disease; or are associated\nwith chronic nephritis, emphysema or different combinations of the\npreceding causes, with various occupations or positions in life, or\nwith other influences of less importance. It is necessary, however,\nto qualify this statement in two respects. In the first place, the\nheart and vessels may have been so damaged already, that is, in\nearly life, that they fall victims to influences which, whether\nin kind or in degree, would have been insufficient to produce\nidiopathic disease of these organs. This brings me to the subject of\nold-standing valvular disease (mostly rheumatic in origin), chronic\nstrain, and adherent pericardium in middle-aged and old subjects.\nA considerable proportion of our cases are of this type, and they\nhave to be mentioned here for the sake of giving completeness to\nthe plan of arrangement, but they are outside the range of our\nimmediate subject. In the second place, hearts and arteries at 40\nthat appear to the naked eye free from damage may be molecularly\nweak, and unable to offer effective resistance even to influences\nof an every-day character. I have now arrived at the last, and\ncertainly one of the most interesting, of the causes of disease of\nthe heart and arteries in middle and advanced life. There are some\npersons whose hearts and arteries cannot carry them through the wear\nand tear of what may be called ordinary life for more than 40 or 50\nyears. The vital energy of the tissues of these organs is exhausted\nprematurely; they are already old at 45; degeneration of the\nmuscle and other cells sets in early, reminding us of the essential\nmyopathic paralysis of children.

PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN,--In my last lecture I presented to\nyou a brief account of the condition of the organs of circulation\nbetween the ages of 40 and 75, and I then proceeded to direct your\nattention to the principal influences which may disorder and damage\nthem during that period of life. I will now attempt to describe\nthe clinical characters and course of the affections of the heart\nand arteries, as I have observed them, in connection with these\ndifferent influences respectively--whether gout, mechanical stress,\nsyphilis, or other. Thereafter, if time permits, I may be able to\nexamine the different symptoms and signs individually in order to\ndiscover the value of each as a guide in diagnosis.\n\nNow, as I have already pointed out, the causes of cardio-vascular\ndisease in the second half of life are very often, indeed usually,\ncomplex. It follows, therefore, that if we desire, as we do most\nparticularly, to discover the effects of each pathogenetic influence\nas distinguished from the others, we must begin our study with the\nsimplest, or purest, or most definite of all, and proceed from it\ntowards those which are more difficult, as well as to combinations\nof causes. It is easy to adopt this method in our present inquiry.\n\n\nTOBACCO HEART.\n\nWe have in tobacco a single distinct influence at work; one that is\nuniversally acknowledged to affect the heart and vessels, and the\nphysiological action of which is understood; one, further, that can\nbe removed (perhaps not without some difficulty, for I have had a\npatient plead for his pipe with tears in his eyes), and certainly\nthat can always be resumed with remarkable readiness--in a word,\na most favourable subject of observation by experiment. It is\nwell, too, to begin the study of tobacco heart in young men, whose\ncirculation is still structurally sound, and thereafter to follow\nup the subject in middle-aged and old persons. Adopting this line\nof inquiry, I have found that the uncomplicated effects of tobacco\non young healthy hearts, as they present themselves clinically,\nare: palpitation in every instance; a sense of irregular action,[6]\npost-sternal oppression and pain in half the cases; and in one out\nof every eight sufferers either angina or uncomfortable sensations\nin", "doc_id": "64d1a5d0-ba71-4fe1-9684-0fb6e443b6e2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "601d772b0ac8ca30d8f8f1f4fed7a29f9c9500807ebfb49d0889536802fe9640", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 44697, "end": 48554}, "relationships": {"1": "7a9e63ce-6a97-4dd0-8895-ffacc479e9df", "2": "1e64fae6-d043-403a-a7c9-ef4c808ee4c7", "3": "820d52dc-060b-4510-bda3-f721f7a46e43"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "820d52dc-060b-4510-bda3-f721f7a46e43": {"__data__": {"text": "some difficulty, for I have had a\npatient plead for his pipe with tears in his eyes), and certainly\nthat can always be resumed with remarkable readiness--in a word,\na most favourable subject of observation by experiment.

Faintness or actual faints occurred in one-third,\nand giddiness and a feeling of impending death in a smaller\nproportion. Turning to the physical signs, the heart proves to be of\nordinary size in 50 per cent. of the patients; in a few it is very\nslightly enlarged; the pr\u00e6cordial impulse is often very weak, but\noccasionally increased in force and frequency, and almost as often\nirregular as not; the pulse tension, with insignificant exceptions,\nI have always found low. Very interesting, in the light of what I\nshall tell you later on, is the fact that of 20 of these patients\ncomplaining of the heart not one presented a cardiac murmur beyond a\nweak mitral systolic bruit, varying with posture or cubitus. This is\nin accordance with the teachings of pharmacology --that tobacco acts\non the terminal branches of the vagus.\n\n  [6] A medical friend who has suffered from tobacco heart assures\n  me that at one period he could distinguish the contractions of the\n  auricles and ventricles.\n\nNow we are in a position to study the tobacco heart in a man of 40;\nand again let us begin with a man who is sound, active, and healthy\notherwise. He complains of his heart, and recognises willingly\n(for he belongs to our own profession), in the discomfort and\nanxiety from which he suffers, the penalty of having smoked for\nyears the strongest and blackest tobacco that he could buy. Yet his\nheart is not enlarged, and the cardiac sounds might be described\nas ordinary were they not peculiarly irregular, the frequency\nchanging every moment and a falter occurring at short intervals.\nThere is not a trace of murmur to be found in connection with\nthe valves and orifices. At ages over 40 a clinical study of the\ntobacco heart is highly instructive from a practical point of view.\nWhilst palpitation is still the common complaint, pain, including\nangina, is put forward more prominently, and so are faintness,\nactual faints, a feeling of impending death, and a sense of cardiac\nirregularity, each intermission being accompanied with a sudden\nstab through the pr\u00e6cordia. Some of you will remember Mr. Barrie's\nquaint account in 'My Lady Nicotine' of what he calls the horrors\nof his smoking days, when the pain at his heart made him hold his\nbreath--\"a sting\" as he describes it, and he believed he was dying.\nIn these subjects the heart is more frequently found to be large and\nfeeble; the same weak systolic murmur is occasionally to be heard;\nthe radial pulse is often irregular, and the vessel wall naturally\nthick. This, you will notice, is a combination of symptoms and signs\nsufficient to alarm the casual observer. But when we examine it more\ndeliberately, in the light of our study of the tobacco heart in\nyoung subjects, on the one hand, and of our knowledge of the normal\nor natural condition of the heart and arteries at 60, on the other\nhand, we are able to reassure ourselves and our patients.

We are\njustified in concluding not only that every cardio-vascular lesion\nwhich may be found in tobacco smokers is not to be put to the credit\nof tobacco, but, _vice vers\u00e2_ (and this is of more interest to us in\nour present inquiry), that every pr\u00e6cordial pain, angina, faintness,\nor irregular pulse in a man of 60 with a full-sized heart is not to\nbe hastily regarded as evidences of grave disease without further\ninquiry as to his habits. The cardiac enlargement and large pulse\nmay be nothing more than the result of a life of bodily and mental\nactivity: the pr\u00e6cordial distress may be the result only of tobacco.\nHow very necessary this caution is will be impressed upon your\nconsideration by the two following cases. The first is that of a man\nof 60, actively engaged in professional pursuits, who first suffered\nfrom pr\u00e6cordial pain of an alarming character four and a half years\nago, and has had attacks since, particularly during exertion and\nafter meals. One day last autumn, at the end of many hours' hard\nwork, cheered by at least 18 cigarettes, he was rushing off to dine\nwith a friend when he was suddenly seized with pr\u00e6cordial pain which\nhe described as fearful, radiating down the left arm. He broke into\na cold sweat, thought that his last hour had come, and for a short\ntime had impairment of consciousness. Shortly after this event he\ntook the advice of his doctors and gave up tobacco (shall I say for\na time?), and from that day to this, now six months, he has had no\nfurther trouble with his heart.\n\nThe second case is equally striking. A man of 55, of fairly active\ndisposition and somewhat full habit of body, was suddenly seized\nwith angina pectoris in October, 1899. The pain was of a dull\nbursting character over the region of the heart, and it passed into\nthe left shoulder, down to the elbow, and settled particularly in\nthe wrist. At the same time there was pain in the upper maxillary\nregion. The heart slowed down from 75 to 50, and the sufferer felt\nthat he was dying. From that time anginal attacks occurred in\nrapid succession, five, six, nine or even eleven in a single day;\noccasionally they came on in the night. This experience continued\nfor nearly two months on end; indeed, it was six months before the\nangina finally ceased. It was instantly relieved with amyl nitrite;\nnitro-glycerin was unsuccessful. In the course of giving advice to\nthis patient I fortunately discovered that he had just laid in a\nstock of 2,000 cigars. The line of treatment was obvious; and the\nresult has been, as I have said, complete recovery.\n\nI have dwelt on the subject of tobacco heart perhaps longer than\nwas necessary, addressing, as I am, a meeting of practitioners of\nexperience and not a class of clinical students. I have done so to\nbring home to us an important consideration which we are all apt\nto overlook in diagnosis and still more in treatment, namely, that\nwhether in an ordinary senile heart, or in a heart that is the seat\nof chronic valvular disease, or in arterial degeneration, something\nmore than the pathological changes have in many instances to be\nregarded--usually some entirely adventitious disturbance which alone\ncalls for treatment, such as", "doc_id": "ca72b9c0-6978-453e-a952-7e5d8b6ebbe2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "905a2986bddda0e2d4ae4fb0bb1070c32a33ac7640ab22f6939c5a3c7b24cd7a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 52371, "end": 56170}, "relationships": {"1": "7a9e63ce-6a97-4dd0-8895-ffacc479e9df", "2": "820d52dc-060b-4510-bda3-f721f7a46e43", "3": "ffb9abf5-0a5d-4acc-bb4c-a9e1c51b0f2f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ffb9abf5-0a5d-4acc-bb4c-a9e1c51b0f2f": {"__data__": {"text": "laid in a\nstock of 2,000 cigars.

In the first\nplace, they are complicated with the many indirect effects which it\nproduces on these organs by deranging the functions of alimentation\nand assimilation, the nervous system and the kidneys, and with the\nsecondary effects on the vessels and heart of chronic nephritis\ndue to the same cause. In the second place, as we saw in my first\nlecture, alcoholism is very commonly associated with nervous strain,\nwith gout and goutiness, with tobacco, with syphilis, and not\nuncommonly with two, or more, or all of these together. Eliminating\nas far as possible these sources of error by careful selection of\ncases, I find that the alcoholic heart in middle and advanced life\npresents clinical characters, as a whole, very different from those\nof tobacco heart, which we have just studied. The most striking and\nimportant of these are the evidences of actual pathological change\nin the size of the heart and the condition of the myocardium. We\nfound no evidence that tobacco causes serious cardiac enlargement,\nand neither may alcohol in quite young subjects, who present mainly\nexcited action both in force and in frequency. But of 28 cases of\nalcoholic heart which I examined clinically in connection with the\npresent inquiry in older subjects, only two hearts were of ordinary\nsize (and as a matter of fact both of these patients were under\n40 years of age). This result is in accord with my pathological\nobservations. For instance, I have carefully followed the condition\nof the heart in an intemperate man of 43, and _post mortem_ found\nthe heart to weigh 17 ounces, to be universally dilated in all\nits chambers, and to present enlargement of the mitral opening\nwithout valvular lesion, corresponding with a weak apex systolic\nmurmur heard during life. These results are also in accord with\nthose in Dr. Maguire's cases of acute dilatation of the heart from\nalcoholism, which he recorded as long ago as 1888[7] (when, I may\nadd, doubts were expressed of the correctness of his conclusions\nby several of our best authorities on cardiac disease), and one of\nwhich occurred in a man of 23. Dr. Mott has found fatty degeneration\nof the myocardium in patients dying suddenly during alcoholism.[8]\nWith hardly an exception the pr\u00e6cordial impulse is weak--indeed,\nit is often imperceptible; the sounds are small and feeble, and\nmay be almost inaudible; in 20 per cent. of my cases a weak apex\nsystolic murmur could be heard, varying with posture and from day\nto day, significant,", "doc_id": "ffb9abf5-0a5d-4acc-bb4c-a9e1c51b0f2f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1e3c08824e7f5d82c45d0cfc024a2fe2820d8a05c3e6fb1cdfd42acfe9c10cbd", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 56153, "end": 59951}, "relationships": {"1": "7a9e63ce-6a97-4dd0-8895-ffacc479e9df", "2": "ca72b9c0-6978-453e-a952-7e5d8b6ebbe2", "3": "56a29587-013a-4623-8650-af516b49ca0a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "56a29587-013a-4623-8650-af516b49ca0a": {"__data__": {"text": "in Dr. Maguire's cases of acute dilatation of the heart from\nalcoholism, which he recorded as long ago as 1888[7] (when, I may\nadd, doubts were expressed of the correctness of his conclusions\nby several of our best authorities on cardiac disease), and one of\nwhich occurred in a man of 23.

The alcoholic heart is irregular and accelerated in about\nhalf the cases. The pulse tension is usually low; in one-third of\nthe instances the radial artery was sclerosed; in one-fifth of them\nthere was slight albuminuria; the legs may be \u0153dematous. The\ncomplaints which the patient makes to us are commonly of palpitation\nof the heart, faintness or actual faints, and pr\u00e6cordial pain; but\nit is very interesting to observe that angina pectoris is rare in\nthe alcoholic as compared with the tobacco heart, in the ratio of 4\nto 15 per cent. With these cardiac symptoms proper there are usually\nassociated the sweats, coldness of the extremities, and depression,\nsinking or lowness characteristic of alcoholism. But it is\nunnecessary for me to fill in this outline sketch of the condition\nof the victim of either acute, or sub-acute, or chronic alcoholism.\nI would rather mention one form of acute alcoholic failure of the\nheart of which I have recently seen a case, but which appears to\nbe rare. A middle-aged woman, at the end of each of her repeated\nbouts of active alcoholism, has violent sickness; prostration passes\ninto collapse, and for 24 hours or more she lies flat on her back,\nwith all the phenomena of what may be called acute air-hunger. She\nbreathes loudly and deeply, at the rate of 36 per minute, with\ngroaning expiration. The expression is alarmed, despairing and\nimploring; the nose is pinched; the surface is livid and cold; the\nbreath is cold; the pulse is practically imperceptible at the wrist;\nand yet the pr\u00e6cordial impulse is both strong and extensive, and the\nrate of the heart greatly accelerated. The condition is at once one\nof collapse and urgent dyspn\u0153a, quite as in one form of so-called\ndiabetic coma; and it is further remarkable in that it may pass off\nsuddenly after having lasted, as I have said, for many hours. It is\ndifficult to resist the conclusion that in such a condition as this\nsome product of alcohol, present in the blood, is the cause of the\nremarkable phenomena.\n\n  [7] Maguire, 'Trans. Clin. Soc. of London,' vol. xx, p. 235.\n\n  [8] Mott, \"Cardio-Vascular Nutrition and its Relation to Sudden\n  Death,\" _Practitioner_, xli, p. 161.\n\nThe course of alcoholic heart in older subjects usually becomes\naffected by the appearance of cirrhosis of the liver, Bright's\ndisease, neuritis, and possibly dementia.

The myocardium is not always beyond repair,\nalthough it and the fine myelinated fibres of the vagus undergo\nfatty degeneration according to Dr. Mott,[9] just as there are\nchanges in the pyramidal cells and fibres of the cerebral cortex in\nthe alcoholic; and the feebleness and irregularity of the heart are\nanalogues of the depression and confusion of the brain.\n\n  [9] Mott, 'The Croonian Lectures on the Degeneration of the\n  Neurone,' p. 110, 1900.\n\n\nGOUT.\n\nOf the many instances of disorder and disease of the heart and\narteries that I have met with in gouty subjects at or over 40 years\nof age, I have made a careful study of 29 taken from my private\ncase-books. Twelve of these (10 M. + 2 F.) had suffered from\nordinary articular gout, the other 17 (6 M. + 11 F.) had irregular\ngout, as defined in my first lecture. The average age was 62. In\nno instance was there albuminuria. The physical condition of the\nheart and arteries and the patient's complaints were remarkably\nalike in the two groups. In 23 of the 29 the heart proved to be\nenlarged, either on one or both sides. In less than half the number\nthe cardiac action was feeble; in a small number the impulse was\nentirely imperceptible; the heart- and pulse- rate was ordinary; the\nrhythm was but seldom irregular. It is a very remarkable fact that\nin no fewer than 12 out of the 29 cases of gouty heart a systolic\nmurmur was to be heard over the aortic area, the manubrium and the\nright carotid, significant of disease either of the aortic arch or\nof the aortic valves--in every instance independently of rheumatism\nor other obvious cause than gout. This result is an interesting\nconfirmation of the pathological observations of Dr. Norman Moore\nand Sir Dyce Duckworth given by the latter,[10] and of the statement\nof Murchison[11] of his experience \"that atheroma of the arteries\nat an unusually early period of life, and diseases of the aortic\nvalves which are not congenital, and are independent of injury\nor rheumatism, are met with far oftener in persons who are the\nsubjects of the lithic acid dyscrasia, or who have had gout, than\nin those who have had no such tendencies.\" In seven (25 per cent.)\nof my cases a more or less developed systolic murmur was found\nin the mitral area, significant either of valvular atheroma and\nsclerosis or of leakage from ventricular dilatation.

The great majority presented distinct\nthickening of the arterial walls. As I suggested in our study of\nthe etiology, these pathological changes appear to be the result of\nmalnutrition of structures (the myocardium, valves and arteries)\nworked at high pressure; and in addition to the local disturbance\nof metabolism in the cardiac and arterial walls, which are fed with\ngouty blood, there is the damaging effect on them of similar disease\nof the _vasa vasorum_ and _vasa cordis_ or coronaries.[13] Besides\na distressing feeling of irregularity, fluttering or intermittency,\nand dyspn\u0153a on exertion, men who are the subjects of gouty heart\ncomplain most frequently of pr\u00e6cordial pain; women more often of\npalpitation and faintness or actual faints. In quite one-fourth\nof all cases of gouty heart the pain is anginal, and such angina\nmay be of the most pronounced type. A friend of my own, aged 60,\nbegan to suffer from gouty angina (diagnosed to be such by his\nfamily physician 40 years ago) at the age of 20. Almost every year,\nsomewhat more frequently for the last 12 years of his life, he was\nliable to be seized with intense pain in the left side of the chest,\nwhich rapidly extended to the neck and down the left arm, with\ntingling in the hand; a sense of great constriction in the chest;\nfaintness, and difficulty of breathing. He had immediately to rest,\nwhereupon the distress subsided; but it did not perfectly disappear\nfor hours. On different occasions also, in connection with these\nanginal seizures, I have known him have free h\u00e6moptysis, complete\nunconsciousness, vomiting, and sudden violent evacuation of the\nbowels. He also suffered from articular gout, and from irregular\ngout in almost every possible form.\n\n  [10] Dyce Duckworth, 'A Treatise on Gout,' 1889, p. 108.\n\n  [11] Murchison, 'Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Liver,' 3rd\n  edition, 1885, p. 637.\n\n  [12] _Cf._ Clifford Allbutt, \"Selections from the Lane Lectures,\"\n  _Philadelphia Med.

In all the cases the heart appeared to be enlarged,\nbut accurate physical examination is difficult or impossible in\nmany of these subjects. The impulse was more often feeble than in\nthe gouty; the cardiac sounds were equally weak, and the second\naortic sound was occasionally accentuated. The pulse corresponded\nwith the gouty pulse in thickness and tension, but it was more often\nfound irregular and hurried.

The friend whose case I have\njust described at some length had led an active life, as I said, for\n40 years; and, as I hope to show in my next lecture, the condition\nis amenable to treatment if this is based on a correct appreciation\nof the cause that is at work. But it is equally true that if correct\nadvice be not given, or if it be given but be neglected, as happens\nso frequently, the endocardium and the aorta and other arteries\nsteadily degenerate, chronic interstitial nephritis makes its\nappearance, and the patient dies either slowly from cardiac failure\nor suddenly from cerebral h\u00e6morrhage.\n\n\nCARDIAC STRAIN.\n\nI will now proceed to consider the clinical characters of a class\nof cases in which you, Sir, are particularly interested--strain\nof the heart in middle and advanced life. To make this part of my\nsubject more plain, I will discuss in the first place acute strain\nof the heart as it occurs after the fortieth year; afterwards I will\nconsider the condition of the heart and arteries at this age in\npersons who have strained them in youth or early manhood.\n\nA man of 65, who came to me complaining of his heart, gave the\nfollowing account of the commencement of his trouble:--Four years\npreviously, on making a very hard stroke at golf (the ball was\nbunkered), he was suddenly seized with a sensation of something\nhaving happened in his heart. He played up to the next hole, but\nnow felt the chest oppressed; he sat down and got relief. This\nexperience was repeated, and he gave up the round. Walking home\ntwo miles, he had to sit down occasionally with the same feeling.\nEver since that occurrence exertion had produced the same effect.\nI found the ordinary physical signs of enlargement of both sides\nof the heart; a scarcely perceptible impulse; the cardiac sounds\nextremely feeble, the second being of a finely ringing quality; the\npulse tense, quiet and regular, but the radial artery by no means\nsclerosed. The patient's principal complaints were of irregular\naction of the heart, which troubled him on lying down or when he\nwas dyspeptic; and, as I have said, of post-sternal oppression on\nexertion.

This man had neither albuminuria nor emphysema, but he\nhad frequently suffered from ordinary articular gout. Belonging\nto this type of cardiac strain I have notes in all of 11 cases,\nwhich I will briefly summarise. Eight were men, three women; and\ntheir average age was 56. In all but one of them the heart was\nlarge, with feeble pr\u00e6cordial impulse; the sounds were small and\nfeeble; the aortic diastolic sound was often ringing; in but one\ncase was there a murmur--aortic systolic; with few exceptions the\nrhythm and the rate of the heart were ordinary. In half the cases\nthe radial artery was sclerosed; in the majority the tension was\nnot increased. Persons who strain their heart after middle life\nchiefly complain of pr\u00e6cordial oppression, dyspn\u0153a on exertion,\na sense of palpitation and irregular action of the heart, and pain,\nwhich may amount to angina; and they may tell us that distress\nand disability in these different forms have troubled them for\nyears. You will have observed that the man whose case I have read\nin particular was the subject of gout; and this brings me to the\ninteresting fact that of these 11 individuals seven were gouty.\nWe have already seen how greatly reduced is the resistance of the\ncardio-vascular system in gouty subjects; and we are prepared for\nthe readiness with which their heart may be strained by exertion--a\nmatter of obvious importance prophylactically. In other cases not\nincluded in this group the strain took the form of valvular injury,\nor it affected hearts already the seats of old-standing valvular\nlesions of rheumatic origin; but the present is not the occasion\nto discuss these. Nor need I add that a not infrequent result\nof acute strain of the aged heart, whether its valves have been\nalready damaged or its myocardium badly nourished, is sudden death.\nNow, I can understand that some of my audience might object to\nthe application of the term \"strain\" to the effect of exertion in\ngouty and senile hearts, just as Professor Clifford Allbutt, who is\nuniversally recognised as the earliest and highest authority on this\nsubject, suggests that the clinical expression \"strain of the heart\"\nrelates only to comparatively young subjects free or nearly free\nfrom degeneration.[14] It might be contended with great reason that\nexertion in these subjects is not a cause of strain or dilatation of\nthe heart, but simply a test, as it were, or the proof, of cardiac\ndebility and disability. But when we come to consider cardiac strain\na little more closely, it may be just as easily maintained that\nevery dilated heart, every dilated cardiac chamber, every dilated\nblood-vessel has been strained. Whether, on the one hand, valvular\ndisease, Bright's disease or emphysema, or, on the other hand,\nmyocardial degeneration, has disturbed that cardinal condition of\na normal circulation that the driving power must always exceed the\nresistance ahead, over-distension and dilatation of the cavities,\nwith excessive stretching of their walls, constitute or consist in\nmechanical strain.

Cases\nof this character would furnish excellent material from which we\nmight attempt to judge of the after-effects of excess or abuse\nof muscular exercise in the young. This is a tempting subject of\ndiscussion, but one far too long and much too important to be taken\nup casually at this time. Therefore, I will content myself with\nsubmitting to you as plainly as I can certain facts bearing on it\nthat have come before me in my present inquiry, along with a few\nsimple observations of a practical bearing. First, then, let me\nread to you the history of what I should call a typical case of the\nkind. A man of 69 complains that as often as he walks any distance\nor climbs a stair he is arrested by a distressing sense of having a\nbar across the lower end of the sternum, breathlessness, irregular\npalpitation of the heart, and a very little choking in the throat;\nthe discomfort has lately deserved the name of pain. His heart is\nvery large, the area of pr\u00e6cordial dulness being increased in all\ndirections and measuring transversely 7 inches. The impulse is\nweak over the left ventricle, but definite in the epigastrium; the\nsounds come in couples--moderately good and very weak respectively,\nwithout murmur; and the radial artery is large and thick, with\nrather low pressure and irregular rhythm. It turns out that for the\nlast 40 years these uncomfortable feelings have troubled the man\nmore or less, and that at three different periods of his life--at\n31, at 42 and at 67--they increased so much as to incapacitate him\nfor many months, the first time with a sudden sense of something\nsnapping in the heart, the second time with a faint, and always,\nas he believes, consequent on overwork. Now this man never had\nrheumatism, nor gout, nor syphilis, and was always a temperate,\ncareful liver; and he volunteers the statement that he first felt\nhis heart at Cambridge, where he was captain of his College boat,\nand was tried for the University boat but felt that he was not fit\nfor it. Belonging to this type of cardiac strain I have selected\n11 cases. The heart is always found to be enlarged, and in about\none-half of the cases it is irregular.

Belonging to this type of cardiac strain I have selected\n11 cases. The heart is always found to be enlarged, and in about\none-half of the cases it is irregular. It may be weak and beating\nat the ordinary rate, but in other instances it is increased both\nin force and frequency. Only in quite exceptional cases did I meet\nwith endocardial murmurs in this group of old strained hearts; as a\nrule the sounds were ordinary, with a disposition to accentuation of\nthe aortic second sound. High tension and sclerosis of the radial\nartery were respectively found in about one-half of the cases. The\npatients complain most commonly of a distressing sense of irregular\npalpitation of the heart, and very commonly of pr\u00e6cordial pain,\nbut rarely of angina. Faintness also is sometimes mentioned. Let\nme hasten to add, with respect to these cases, that they do not\ninclude any instances of direct injury of the valves mechanically.\nRupture or stretching of the aortic and mitral valves during\nexertion furnishes us with some very remarkable clinical cases; but\nit is with parietal strain that we are concerned now--mechanical\nover-stretching of the cardiac walls, which are thereafter left with\nbut a narrow margin of the elastic and muscular reserve required\nby them to meet trying circumstances of any kind, particularly\nexertion. The subjects of dilatation of the heart from mechanical\nstress suffer by no means from what is commonly called \"heart\ndisease,\" excepting in the worst cases, but yet they feel their\nhearts comparatively, and it may be seriously, disabled. Naturally\nthey associate these feelings of disability with fresh attempts\nat exercise or exertion, as in the case which I have just read. I\npointed out in my first lecture that such exertion is not by any\nmeans connected with the patient's occupation or daily duties, but\nquite often occurs during unwise attempts on his part to resume\nat 50 the athletic exercises of his youth in order to reduce his\nweight, relieve his liver, or dispel gout. It is not wonderful that\nunder such circumstances a permanently enlarged and badly-nourished\nheart should become embarrassed, or even seriously deranged or\nstill further strained. I have known a man of 43, going straight\nfrom London to the Alps, have not only pr\u00e6cordial distress but\ndropsy of his legs after his first ascent in his regular holiday.\nIndeed, the man who has reached later middle-life with his heart\nenlarged by years of great bodily activity in youth, and settles\ndown quietly on retirement, let us say from the navy, sometimes\nfinds that ordinary exercise is sufficient to produce alarming\ncardiac distress and curious loss of courage, obviously due to the\nmuscular tissue of the thickened cardiac walls having fallen quite\nout of condition. How instructive, for instance, is the following\ncase:--A gentleman of 60, who has led from his boyhood upwards a\nlife of physical activity and at the same time of temperance, and\nhas suffered from neither syphilis nor rheumatism, but possibly from\na very mild attack of gout, settles in a relaxing provincial town,\ncontinues to eat heartily, and considers that a little work in the\ngarden is sufficient exercise for him.

The bearing of such a case as this\non the pathology, prevention and treatment of certain cases of heart\ndisease in old subjects will be obvious to all.\n\nWe must be careful, however, to observe that neither unwise\nabandonment of wholesome exercise, nor ill-advised return to\nphysical exertion, separately or in succession, can be regarded\nas the only cause of the recrudescence of cardiac distress after\n40 in those who have strained their circulation in youth. Any one\nof the many circumstances that produce cardiac failure and dropsy\nin chronic valvular disease may lead to embarrassment and fresh\ndilatation of the simply enlarged heart: an\u00e6mia and chronic disease,\nthe acute specific fevers including pneumonia, emphysema, granular\nkidney, gout, syphilis, tobacco and alcohol poisoning, as well as\nanxiety and worry, and in women the advent of the menopause; and I\nmay say here parenthetically that pains at the heart in athletic\nyouths are sometimes due to the tobacco smoking in which they\noften indulge socially when the exercise is finished--not to strain\nat all. In these cases of old cardiac strain, as in every form of\nchronic valvular disease and of chronic heart disease of all kinds,\nnot only the original and permanent lesion, but the recent and\nprobably temporary circumstance that caused the failure has to be\nascertained and fully respected in connection with prognosis and\ntreatment.\n\n\nSYPHILIS.\n\nSyphilis appears to account for a very considerable proportion of\nthe more serious cases of heart disease which we meet with in older\nsubjects--excluding of course chronic valvular disease originating\nremotely in endocarditis. But I ought to repeat here what I have\nalready mentioned, that syphilis as a cause of cardio-vascular\nlesions is very often associated with other morbific influences,\nparticularly strain and alcohol. Of its position as the principal\ncause of grave disease of the valves as distinguished from the walls\nof the heart, originating in middle life, there can be no question.\nNo fewer than nine out of 28 cases, of which I have private notes,\nwere the subjects of double aortic disease; practically all the\nothers had", "doc_id": "910d7266-93f1-42f7-9293-c4aacddd2bb1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "20a0bdff42e750859521c71b3c242fd9f0de959944220c76a697b986743db58d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 85805, "end": 89530}, "relationships": {"1": "7a9e63ce-6a97-4dd0-8895-ffacc479e9df", "2": "f7a1946a-1a06-43c1-9091-8f89d95622a4", "3": "68731716-6cf9-41ab-a56c-4b0738ea1f90"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "68731716-6cf9-41ab-a56c-4b0738ea1f90": {"__data__": {"text": "and\ntreatment.\n\n\nSYPHILIS.\n\nSyphilis appears to account for a very considerable proportion of\nthe more serious cases of heart disease which we meet with in older\nsubjects--excluding of course chronic valvular disease originating\nremotely in endocarditis.

When we consider that syphilis does also\naffect the myocardium primarily; that fibroid disease, chronic\naneurysm and fatty degeneration of the heart are all traceable to\nspecific disease of the coronaries in many instances; and, finally,\nthat many of the subjects of syphilitic cardio-vascular disease\nhave perished before 40, the magnitude of this cause can be fully\nrealised. I believe that the profession in general have not yet\nwoke up, if I may say so, to the gravity of this subject. How\nseldom we inquire for a history of specific disease in patients\ncoming to us with cardiac disease in middle life! To no one, as\nfar as my reading goes, are we so much indebted for the truth on\nthis subject as to my friend and colleague Dr. Mott. Thirteen\nyears ago he published a paper on 21 cases of sudden death from\ncardio-vascular disease, and in nine of these there was a history of\neither actual or probable syphilis. What was of greater interest,\nhowever, at that early date, he drew attention to the association\nof syphilitic cardio-vascular lesions with Bright's disease in the\nbroad acceptation of the term. Dr. Mott's work in the interval on\nsyphilitic lesions of the arterial system of the brain has been so\nbrilliant, and is so generally known, that it requires nothing more\nthan this appreciative mention by me, and it saves me the trouble of\nan excursion into the subjects of cerebral h\u00e6morrhage and thrombosis\nin connection with these lectures.\n\n\nNERVOUS STRAIN.\n\nI confess that it is difficult to say much that is of real\ndiagnostic value on the clinical aspect of cardio-vascular disorders\nand disease from nervous strain. As I remarked in discussing this\nsubject from the etiological point of view, several factors come\ninto play besides nervous excitement followed by exhaustion and\ntheir effects on the heart, great vessels and cerebral arteries;\nand the cases, therefore, are found to present a puzzling variety\nof features. Certain clinical characters are, however, common to\nthe majority. Arterial tension is high; the radial artery is thick,\nsometimes markedly so; the heart enlarges; and in about one-half of\nthe cases a systolic murmur is to be heard either in the aortic or\nin the mitral area, significant of chronic endocardial lesions--all\nreadily intelligible results of cerebral strain in the light of\nour knowledge of the innervation of the cardio-vascular system. I\nhave already pointed out that in some of these patients polyuria\nand temporary albuminuria occur along with the high tension and\nthe increased action of the heart; but the heart may fail later\non.

Fortunately for me my immediate predecessor in this chair on\nthe medical side, our distinguished Fellow, Dr. Samuel West, took\nfor his subject the \"Clinical Aspects of Granular Kidney,\" and thus\nrelieved me of a task which he was so much better able to discharge\nthan I. Emphysema must also be passed over with the single remark\nthat it is a very common accompaniment both of vascular and cardiac\ndegenerations.\n\nI trust you do not conclude that the description which I have just\ngiven you of the clinical characters of these various disorders and\ndiseases of the heart is in any sense complete. It only relates to\nthe most prominent symptoms and signs as they present themselves to\nus in what might be called the every-day life of the patient, at a\nperiod in the history of his case precedent to failure. In all of\nthem there may occur occasional attacks of acute embarrassment of\nthe heart and lungs from one or more of a variety of causes, such\nas indigestion, excitement or over-exertion. Sooner or later, also,\nthere occurs either cardiac dropsy--insidiously developed after\nincreasing local distress, growing dyspn\u0153a and \"bad nights\"; or\nBright's disease; or cerebral thrombosis or h\u00e6morrhage, or acute\nmyocardial failure with angina: or the patient dies from failure of\nthe heart in the course of some acute disease such as bronchitis or\npneumonia.

VICE-PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN,--In this, the concluding lecture\nof the series, I will attempt to deal with the applications of\nthe facts and considerations which I submitted to you on the two\nprevious occasions when I had the honour to address you. I trust\nthat what I then laid before you proved to be of some interest.\nLet us see now whether it is practically useful. However much the\netiology and pathology of the diseases and disorders of the heart\nand arteries in middle and advanced life may deserve study as\nmatters of natural history, we should be disappointed if they could\nnot be turned to account in prognosis and treatment. These are the\nsubjects I propose to discuss this evening.\n\nNow, prognosis and treatment, to be rational and useful, have to be\nbased on as full and as correct a diagnosis as knowledge permits.\nThe present disposition is to fall short of this; to rest content\nwith an incomplete diagnosis. We say that the patient's \"heart\nis dilated,\" that he has \"arterial degeneration,\" that there is\n\"fatty degeneration.\" But you will remember that we have found that\ncardiac dilatation may be present in every kind of cardio-vascular\ndegeneration; that the arteries are naturally enlarged and thickened\nafter middle life, and that we refused to call these changes morbid.\nClearly, therefore, a purely anatomical diagnosis of this sort\nis insufficient. If you are asked what the prognosis is of fatty\ndegeneration of the heart, you answer that you must first be told\nwhether syphilitic or gouty disease of the coronary arteries, or\nstrain, or alcoholism, or phosphorus-poisoning or an\u00e6mia is the\ncause of it. When you are planning the treatment of dilatation of\nthe heart you first determine whether the dilatation is a result\nof the stretching of a sound heart by overfilling during muscular\neffort, or of the insufficient emptying of failing chambers with\ndegenerated and feeble walls. Obviously what we ought to determine\nin these instances and in every instance is the origin of the\ndisease. The ultimate diagnosis to be reached for practical purposes\nis the etiological diagnosis.\n\nIs this possible? Does our knowledge of the nature, characters and\ncourse of these cardio-vascular affections enable us to say, after\ninvestigating a case, what the kind of the pathological change is\nthat constitutes the disease, or in what respect the physiological\nmechanisms are disordered? Can the cause of these degenerations of\nthe heart and arteries be determined in each instance? How is the\npractitioner to proceed to do so? What method might be followed with\nadvantage in making a complete diagnosis of heart disease in older\nsubjects?\n\nA man of 60 consults us about his heart. He says that it has caused\nhim a good deal of concern lately. More specifically he describes\na sense of oppression behind the sternum as often as he exerts\nhimself, and palpitation with consciousness of irregular cardiac\naction when he goes to bed. We inquire for other familiar cardiac\nsymptoms, such as pain, angina, fluttering, faintness, giddiness,\nand a sense of impending death. We find that one or more are present\noccasionally, and that they have increased in number and degree\nduring the last few months or years. Perhaps cough, nocturnal\northopn\u0153a and dropsy may be beginning to give trouble. The next\npart of the inquiry relates to the patient's previous history\nfrom childhood upwards.

Which of the acute diseases has he had?\nAcute rheumatism, chorea, scarlet fever, typhoid, diphtheria and\ninfluenza must be mentioned individually, and in women the nature\nof any puerperal disease from which they may have suffered. Gout,\nirregular gout, gravel, eczema, sick headache, asthma must be\ninquired after with the same minuteness, and so must syphilis. We\nnext hear an account of any accident which the patient may have met\nwith, such as a blow, or a fall from a horse or a carriage. This\nbrings us naturally to question him about his occupation and modes\nof relaxation and amusements--whether active or sedentary, regular\nor irregular, their characters otherwise, and their direct effects,\nincluding strain. More difficult to elicit is a correct account of\nthe patient's habits--in respect of food, stimulants and tobacco,\nand his manner of life generally. As I said in my first lecture,\nthis is an inquiry which the family practitioner has an opportunity\nto carry out much more successfully than the hospital physician\nor consultant. The family practitioner has known for years of his\ncardiac patient's work and worries; it may be of his large eating,\nof his secret drinking, of the history of syphilis in earlier years.\nIt is always well also to inquire after a family history of gout,\nrheumatism and heart disease. A list of questions like this sounds\nfar more formidable than it is in reality. A few minutes suffice to\narrive at the truth. We already have a pretty fair notion what we\nhave to deal with, whether strain, gout, syphilis, tobacco, an old\nrheumatic lesion, or a combination of two or more of these.\n\nWe next proceed to physical examination, beginning with the pulse\nand arteries, and passing on to the heart and associated structures.\nThe characters of the pr\u00e6cordial impulse--particularly the seat\nof the apex-beat and the strength of the impulse--are closely (I\nmight almost say laboriously) investigated. We must never yield to\nthe temptation to disregard weakness or absence of the impulse.\nLike many other negative signs it is apt to be overlooked. Then the\npr\u00e6cordial dulness is mapped out by means of light percussion.\nFinally, auscultation reveals to us the presence or absence of\nmurmurs and the characters of the sounds--in the standing and\nrecumbent postures, and, if necessary, after a little exertion. The\nrelative loudness of the first and second sounds over the different\nparts of the pr\u00e6cordia is particularly worthy of note.\n\nNow let us suppose that we have found a mitral systolic murmur. We\nask ourselves whether it is structural or whether it is functional,\nthat is, due to relaxation and dilatation of the ventricular walls.\nIf structural, with which (if any) of the diseases elicited in the\nman's previous history would it correspond? Most probably with\ngout or glycosuria. Thus we attempt to connect the lesion with\nits cause, and the cause with its effects, and have reached the\nultimate diagnosis.

So with other valvular murmurs: for example,\nan aortic diastolic murmur proves to be related to syphilis. If\nthere be no murmur audible, we naturally think of dilatation with\nfailure, or of enlargement from strain, from Bright's disease, from\narterial sclerosis, from emphysema, from an insufficient or impure\nblood-supply in the coronary arteries, from disordered innervation,\nor from some rarer cause, such as adherent pericardium; and then,\nwith these associations in our minds, we review once more the\npatient's history, and generally succeed in our diagnosis.\n\nHere let me recount the significance of the principal signs and\nsymptoms which I detailed to you in my last lecture, considered in\nthe reverse order on this occasion, some of which are of real value\nin differentiating the causes of cardio-vascular degeneration. To\nbegin with negative facts: a mitral pre-systolic murmur is never\nsignificant of a degenerative lesion. Secondly, when we meet with\nan aortic diastolic murmur, whether alone or along with an aortic\nsystolic murmur, we may safely conclude that we have to deal with\nsomething more than atheroma produced by regular or irregular gout\nand associated metabolic disturbance, cardio-vascular disease of\nnervous origin and alcoholic or tobacco heart, even if there be\nevidence of the presence of one or more of these in the case.\nAortic incompetence developed in later life is the result of\nsyphilis, or of acute or chronic valvular strain; but, of course,\nmany instances of this lesion met with after the age of 40 can\nbe traced to juvenile endocarditis of rheumatic or other origin.\nAlways a serious lesion, aortic incompetence due to syphilis, or to\nsyphilis and strain, is particularly grave, as being so frequently\nassociated with coronary disease and consequent myocardial\ndegeneration--fatty or fibroid, acute softening, and sudden fatal\nfailure. A fully-developed basic systolic murmur, audible over the\naortic area and manubrium and along the course of the carotid,\nis a very common sign of atheroma of the aortic arch and valves\nand great vessels in association with regular or irregular gout,\ndiabetes, corpulence and allied disorders of nutrition. It is also\none of the physical signs of syphilitic and traumatic affections of\nthe aorta and aortic valves and of remote endocarditis. Further,\nthese lesions are so often accompanied by similar degenerations in\nthe coronary arteries and consequent myocardial degeneration, that\nthe basic systolic murmur ought at least to raise the suspicion\nof this in the observer's mind. An ill-developed basic systolic\nmurmur is not uncommon in alcoholism, chronic Bright's disease and\nnervous strain, but it is difficult to dissociate from an\u00e6mia. A\nfully-developed systolic murmur audible in the mitral area, I mean\nindependently of ventriculo-auricular leakage in cardiac failure,\nis usually traceable to early endocarditis of rheumatic or other\norigin, rarely to injury, including ordinary juvenile strain of the\nvalves or walls, or to Graves's disease.

But in some instances it\nis unquestionably due to valvular atheroma and attendant sclerosis,\ncaused by gout or other disturbances of metabolism, including the\neffects of free living; and in these instances the observer must\nnot overlook the possible association of coronary disease and fatty\ndegeneration. If a systolic mitral murmur prove to be somewhat\nindefinite and affected by posture, cubitus and effort, to vary\nunder observation from day to day, and to disappear under treatment,\nit is of no more value to us in differential diagnosis than that\nit signifies relaxation and weakness, or disorderly action, of the\nleft ventricle, consequent on any one of the recognised causes of\nfailure or disturbance of the heart, including the different cardiac\npoisons, overwork, an\u00e6mia, acute disease, poverty and the like, and\nthis whether in a heart previously sound or previously enlarged or\npreviously the seat of valvular disease. An accentuated ringing\nsecond sound in the aortic area, or more extensively, is of great\nvalue in the diagnosis of arterial tension and of aortic atheroma or\nof both, but it is associated with far too many different causes to\nbe of much use in differential diagnosis. It should suggest a most\ncareful search for Bright's disease. Slight reduplication of the\nfirst sound is common over the heart strained in youth and the heart\ndegenerated by alcoholism and metabolic disorders, but everyone\nknows that it is not unusual in a variety of other conditions,\nhealthy and morbid. On the other hand, the _bruit de galop_, or\ncantering rhythm of cardiac sounds--definite doubling of the first\nsound followed by loud, accentuated, ringing second sound--is\npractically pathognomonic of Bright's disease, and is one of the\nmost valuable, because one of the most ominous, of physical signs in\nconnection with the cardio-vascular system. A normally-sized heart\nwith irregularity, increased frequency, and a variable systolic\nmurmur in the mitral area, is characteristic of tobacco poisoning. A\nheart enlarged on both sides, and acting irregularly without murmur,\nis (apart from cardiac failure) suggestive of strain in early life.\n\nCardiac symptoms taken individually are of less diagnostic value\nthan signs. No symptom is pathognomonic. Palpitation is a nearly\nuniversal phenomenon of cardiac disease and disorder.

And, further, that they inform\nus of the seat of at least some of the lesions, valvular, parietal\nand vascular. A little trouble, patience and attentive observation\nare all that are required to reach a complete or working diagnosis.\nNow we may approach the great practical subjects of prognosis and\ntreatment with some confidence.\n\n\nPROGNOSIS.\n\nBeginning with the simplest kind of cardio-vascular disorder, let us\nsee what the prognosis is in tobacco heart. You will have gathered\nfrom what I had to say on this subject in my last lecture, and\nindeed you know as men of observation and experience, that it is\ncomparatively favourable. All the cases I have had an opportunity to\nwatch did well, provided the cause of their distress was avoided and\nthe heart and vessels were otherwise healthy. Further, improvement\nbegins early, and it may be rapid and recovery complete; but you\nwill remember that one patient, whose case I detailed to you,\ncontinued to have alarming angina for six months after giving up\ntobacco. Recurrence attends resumption of the habit, but some of\nits votaries contrive to continue to smoke just short of inducing\nserious discomfort. Unless a successful effort at reform be made,\ncardiac trouble may continue indefinitely. But even then I cannot\nsay that I have seen serious damage done by tobacco alone in\nsound hearts, nor arterial sclerosis, as has been stated by some\nauthorities.\n\nAn entirely different and most unfavourable estimate is to be formed\nof the prospect of life in the alcoholic heart. Naturally, a certain\nproportion of cases recover if the disease be of recent development,\nthe condition uncomplicated, and treatment faithfully carried\nout. Unfortunately, as a rule, we have to deal with alcoholism in\nwhich all these conditions of success are wanting. The habit is\nestablished, other organs besides the heart are involved, other\ndiseases than alcoholism are present, and the patient has neither\nthe inclination nor the power to follow our advice. Cirrhosis,\nneuritis, dementia complicate the cardiac degeneration, or, more\ncorrectly, it complicates one or all of these. Chronic Bright's\ndisease is made to account for a number of deaths in the mortality\nreturns that strictly belong to alcoholism. Occasionally the end\ncomes suddenly from fatty degeneration, or in the course of some\nacute disease; otherwise, as we have seen, by slow cardiac failure\nand dropsy.\n\nPrognosis in gouty heart, including the heart of the man with\ngoutiness, glycosuria and other irregular forms of the disease, is\na subject of considerable practical difficulty. In my last lecture\nI read to you a short account of the case of a friend of my own\nwho had had occasional attacks of gouty angina for 40 years.

In my last lecture\nI read to you a short account of the case of a friend of my own\nwho had had occasional attacks of gouty angina for 40 years. And\ncertainly a large proportion of the old ladies of 60 or 70, whom\nyou all have had as patients for years on end with weak heart\nand systolic murmur in the aortic area, owe their disablement\nto gout, if my observations are correct. The lesion proper of\nthe aorta and aortic valves in these cases is atheroma, but the\ndamage is accompanied with repair in the form of sclerosis, which,\nby increasing the loudness of the bruit, adds unreasonably to\nour anxiety about the case. Equally certain it is that patients\nbelonging to this class improve under treatment. Still, the\ncondition of arrest cannot go on indefinitely. In addition to\nextrinsic dangers, particularly those of Bright's disease, cerebral\nthrombosis and h\u00e6morrhage, and bronchitis, failure of the heart\nis liable to supervene and prove fatal from the gravest of all\nintrinsic causes, namely, coronary degeneration. As this increases,\nthe myocardium is steadily more and more impoverished; its\ncontractile vigour declines, and residual dilatation of the chambers\nsets in with mechanical congestion of the viscera. Complaints of\n\"the heart\" increase, the breathing becomes oppressed, the face\nassumes more and more the characteristic \"cardiac\" appearance, and\ndropsy creeps up the lower limbs. Even then the prognosis is not\nhopeless, for undoubtedly a certain proportion of cases of dropsy in\nold persons with degenerated heart and vessels are still amenable to\nrational treatment. But the case has occasionally a more dramatic\ntermination. As I was able to illustrate after my second lecture by\na specimen from the Museum of Charing Cross Hospital, a branch of\none of the coronary arteries that has been narrowed by atheroma for\nan indefinite length of time, with consequent cardiac weakness and\ndiscomfort, may any moment become thrombosed rapidly, apparently\nin consequence of some passing depression or other unfavourable\ninfluence, just as in thrombosis of degenerated cerebral vessels.\nFatal angina is the result. This is a point of great practical\nimportance--that sudden death will occur in old gouty subjects not\nfrom the lesion of which a basic or an apical systolic murmur is the\nevidence and which causes us concern, but from associated coronary\natheroma, which we probably never suspect; indeed, that it may occur\nin those subjects with no murmur whatsoever to attract our attention\nand excite our fears.\n\nStill more unfavourable must be the forecast in syphilitic lesions\nof the heart and vessels. Of 18 of my cases in which the result was\nknown, only one-half improved under treatment, and 20 per cent. of\nthem died within a few years (some indeed within a few weeks) of the\ndiscovery of their disease.

Aneurysm\nmakes its appearance in other instances, of which the patient dies,\nor he is carried off by general paralysis or Bright's disease.\n\nWhat prospect have we to hold out to the man who has strained the\nwalls of his heart by muscular effort? I believe that one can speak\nwith some confidence on this subject. The middle-aged patient who\nover-stretched his cardiac walls as a youth may be comforted with\nthe opinion that the condition is not a fatal one. The average\nduration of 11 cases of this order I found to have been 30 years\nwhen they came under my observation; the minimum duration was nine\nyears, the maximum 50 years. This last case deserves particular\nmention. The patient was first seen by me for failure of the heart\nwith cardiac dropsy, consequent on fresh breakdown after exertion\nduring a holiday; and it is most encouraging to observe that\ncompensation was restored by treatment, and that now, 12 months\nafter that event, he is not only alive, but able to carry on light\nprofessional work. This case also illustrates what I have told you\nrespecting the course of the affection, and the prospect before the\npatients, in long-standing strain--that there is continual liability\nto fresh embarrassment of the heart during exertion, in which they\nappear to have a lasting inclination to indulge. If they happen\nto follow an occupation that entails occasional effort, or effort\nwith excitement and worry (if they happen, let us say, to be busy\npractitioners of medicine), they suffer in the same way from attacks\nof tachycardia, distressing palpitation and anxiety. Indeed, as I\npointed out in my second lecture, they are readily upset by other\ninfluences besides these, including indigestion, to which the victim\nof hurry and worry is peculiarly liable; and they must be prepared\nto have to lead a life of comparative temperance and self-denial.\n\nNeither is strain of the heart for the first time after 40 by any\nmeans so grave as might be expected. Of course, sudden muscular\neffort occasionally accounts for sudden death in old men. But it\nis astonishing how, under such circumstances, quite old persons do\nrecover from conditions of extreme distress lasting acutely for\nhalf an hour--for instance, after running with a heavy bag to catch\na train. The majority of my patients described their condition as\nimproved after a time, but others relapsed; and on the whole the\ncorrect prognosis is that they must expect to remain variously\ndisabled--that is, liable to pr\u00e6cordial distress and dyspn\u0153a on\nmore than moderate exertion, or when subjected to circumstances of\nother kinds that tax the heart.\n\nCardio-vascular disorder and disease referable to nervous strain\npure and simple is amenable to treatment by complete and prolonged\nrest or relaxation in the majority of instances. Still, death may\noccur from sudden cardiac failure; or should advice be neglected\nor soon forgotten, as happens so frequently in these subjects,\nthe attendant high arterial tension and vascular degeneration too\noften end in cerebral lesions, with or without Bright's disease.

Very naturally, unsound\nvessels and a murmur over the pr\u00e6cordia weigh heavily against the\nprospect of recovery from pneumonia, for example; and yet how often\ndo we not find a patient of 70 with one or both of these disturbing\nconditions come safely through such an illness! Here, again, I\nbelieve it is in great measure the true nature of the old-standing\ndisease, not the physical signs such as irregularity of pulse or\nmitral bruit, that ought to be taken into account. A heart enlarged\nand a radial artery thickened by prolonged activity and nothing else\nwill suffice to carry a man safely through an attack of influenzal\npneumonia; but what chance is there for the chronic alcoholic under\nsimilar circumstances, or for the subject of chronic Bright's\ndisease?\n\nSo much for the general prognosis in each of these kinds of\ncardio-vascular disorder and disease. But it is the particular\nprognosis that we have to attempt to estimate--that is, the\nprognosis in the individual patient as he comes before us and\nasks us that trying question, \"What is my prospect of life and\nhealth\"? We diagnose, if possible, the precise nature of his cardiac\naffection, and apply to the best of our ability the conclusions\nwhich I have just submitted to you, and at the same time we estimate\nas correctly as possible the man's personal condition, character and\ndisposition. For, whatever may be determined with respect to the\naverage patient by an analysis of a large number of these cases, the\nindividual patient's future in disease of the heart of every kind,\ndegenerations included, greatly depends on the care that he takes\nof himself. This introduces us to another consideration. However\nearnestly we may attempt to estimate the prognosis on a strictly\nrational system--that is, by basing it on an accurate and complete\ndiagnosis--we cannot deny that when the individual patient is before\nus we are influenced directly by certain of the symptoms and signs,\nwithout asking ourselves what their respective pathological meaning\nmay be. True bradycardia, the story of an unmistakable attack of\nangina pectoris, a loud aortic diastolic murmur, the _bruit de\ngalop_--these instantly give us great concern before we have had\ntime to translate them into the language of morbid anatomy. Very\nnaturally we attempt to carry this method too far, and to reach a\nprognosis, as it were, by a short cut, by attaching a prognostic\nvalue to each clinical phenomenon--palpitation, pr\u00e6cordial\noppression, faintness, lethal sensations, and so on.

Now, quite\nirrespective of the unscientific character of this proceeding, it\nis of little practical service. Even when we have listened to an\naccount from a middle-aged man of an attack of angina pectoris,\nwhat can we tell him of his prospect of life until we have learned\nwhether he be guilty of excessive smoking or drinking, whether he\nbe gouty, whether he have lately strained his heart or no? What\nI do regard as really valuable prognostically, in the way of a\nsimple clinical observation, is the determination of progressive\nsymptoms and signs. A man of 72 complains of oppression over the\nlower sternal region as often as he climbs a hill. Twelve months\nlater he comes and tells us that he has had an attack of severe pain\nacross the top of the chest during the night. Another year passes,\nand he returns to say that now he cannot hasten on the street\nwithout pr\u00e6cordial distress; and it is noted that the second aortic\nsound, previously thick in character, is slightly blowing. By the\nfourth year of observation the patient, having had influenza in\nthe interval, complains of an auto-audible murmur, and of actual\npain in the chest; there is now a fully-developed aortic diastolic\nmurmur, and his ankles swell occasionally. Prognosis was only too\neasy in this case, without inquiry into either the cause or the\nlesion. A few months later true angina occurred, and very shortly\nthe patient died, after twenty-four hours' severe suffering.\n\n\nTREATMENT.\n\nNot the least advantage of the etiological standpoint of our\nsurvey of the disorders and diseases of the heart and arteries\nin middle and advanced life is the rational as well as hopeful\nline of treatment which it enables us to pursue. On the whole,\nwe can control morbific influences more easily than we can alter\npathological processes; and (what is of equal or even greater\nimportance) a knowledge of the causes of disease often enables us to\nprevent what we could not possibly cure. For all that, the etiology\nof heart disease furnishes us with but one set of many invaluable\nindications for treatment. We must have also a clear mental picture\nof the pathological anatomy of the conditions we would attempt to\nmodify--for instance, of the damage wrought by gout on the mitral\nvalves and aortic arch, by syphilis on the coronary arteries, by\nstrain on the walls of the different cardiac chambers. No less\nnecessary is it for the practitioner to take into account, before\nproceeding to prescribe, the clinical characters and course of\nthe case in hand. As I have said more than once already, a large\nproportion of the distress, disabilities and dangers attending\ndegeneration of the heart are due to some additional or extrinsic\ndisturbance--distension of the stomach, constipation, worry or\nexertion--which alone, not the pathological condition, calls for\ntherapeutical attention.\n\nIt appears, then, that the whole natural history of the diseases\nand disorders of the heart--and, I might add, of every individual\ncase--has to be studied, and the value of its different parts\nabsolutely and relatively estimated, before rational treatment can\nbe ordered.

The toxic effects of\ntobacco, alcohol, tea, &c. are due to abuse, from thoughtlessness or\nignorance, or from indisposition rather than inability to exercise\nself-control. The abuse of tobacco appears to create so much\ndiscomfort or even alarm, of a kind which the sufferer cannot fail\nto refer to its cause, that the remedy is effected automatically,\nand no great harm is done. We seldom have to do more than confirm\nthe patient's suspicions in this direction, and recommend temporary\nabstinence from the cigarette or pipe and greater care in the\nfuture. With alcohol it is a different matter. Alcoholism grows by\nwhat it feeds on, and our best efforts are often vain. The present\nis hardly an occasion for dwelling on this subject--the duty of the\nprofession to their patients and friends in respect of the abuse of\nalcohol. Still, I should not feel that I had discharged to the best\nof my ability, or in full conformity with my strong convictions,\nthe duties of the honourable position which by your favour I\noccupy as Lettsomian Lecturer, if I did not urge you to exercise\nmore fully than is at present exercised your personal influence to\ndiscourage habitual drinking. I believe (because I have found) that\nmany men who are not open to arguments of an abstract kind, can\nbe made to pause and reconsider their manner of living by having\na concrete presentment of their condition and its results placed\nbefore them--in plain English, by being thoroughly frightened.\n\"Heart disease\" is a powerful argument to employ with persons of\nthis class, and it is one that is also justified by the issues at\nstake. Of syphilis and the havoc that it works on heart, aorta and\nthe vascular system generally, but particularly within the nervous\nsystem, I need not speak. The profession, as I have said, is not\nyet sufficiently alive to it: what can the public be expected to\ndo in the way of prevention? Gout, corpulence and allied metabolic\ndisorders, those fruitful sources of cardio-vascular disorders and\natheroma, call for temperance not only in drinking but in eating.\nWhilst the question continues to be discussed which particular\narticles of food ought to be avoided by gouty individuals, let us\nall join in offering them one bit of advice of the value of which\nthere can be no doubt: whatever they eat, to eat little.

To those who can afford\nthus to transgress--to the well-to-do--excess in food is a much\nmore serious menace to health and life than excess in drink, and\nit is specially so in respect of senile affections of the heart,\nsome of which have been distinctly recognised to owe their origin\nto over-indulgence, while all are distinctly aggravated by it.\"[15]\nWith the observance of this simple and wholesome dietetic rule must\ngo attention to free elimination by all the excretory channels, and\nthe insurance of sufficient exercise and enjoyment of fresh air.\nIf we wish to impress this consideration on our own minds and give\neffect to it in our practice, let us call to mind for a moment the\nnumber of cases that I have submitted to you of atheroma of the\naorta in stout matronly women of sedentary and luxurious habits, in\nwhom, indeed, this degeneration is quite as common as in men.\n\n  [15] G. W. Balfour, 'The Senile Heart,' p. 236, 1894.\n\nI have already said so much on the subject of cardiac strain that\nit is unnecessary and would be uninteresting to return to the\nquestion of the prevention of it. We have seen how often it occurs\nin the middle-aged or old subject by ill-considered attempts at\nathleticism. Moderation and due respect for age are the true\nguides to the useful enjoyment of exercise after 40. As for the\nevil effects of nervous influences on the circulation, in addition\nto anxiety, care, misfortune and grief, which are usually beyond\nour control, nervous strain, as distinguished from simple hard\nintellectual work, often must be relaxed if cardio-vascular damage\nis to be prevented. I refer to the cases of persons in positions of\ngreat responsibility with heavy complex prolonged duties, which they\nfail to overtake without exhaustion consequent on high pressure and\nexcitement.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI would not have dwelt so long upon the measures calculated to\nprevent degeneration of the heart, were it not that they have to be\nemployed with equal strictness and perseverance in the treatment\nof cardio-vascular disease when it is already established and our\nassistance is sought with anxiety. The etiological indications have\nstill to be respected faithfully; on this I need not dwell. The\nnext question is:--What can be done for the pathological changes\nwrought on the arteries and the valves and walls of the heart? In\nsyphilitic lesions we do not hesitate to say that potassium iodide\nshould be given freely: it is a specific remedy of great value.\nCan the atheromatous process be influenced with equal or with any\nsuccess?

It depends on tox\u00e6mia and an\u00e6mia; the obvious indication is\nto purify and enrich the blood. This, at least in respect of gout,\nglycosuria and corpulence, as we have just seen, must be effected by\na thorough reform in every department of personal hygiene. Arsenic\nand moderate doses of iodides, combined with an excess of alkalis,\nare calculated to promote the same end. Dr. Mott has shown that\natheroma, whether of valves or of vessels, can be traced in many\ninstances to disease of the _vasa cordis_ and _vasa vasorum_. This\ncarries us a step forward in our quest for indications, but the\npractical conclusion remains--that the healthy nutrition of the\nsmaller arteries has to be restored by attention to the blood and\nthe use of specific remedies.\n\nSo much for valvular and vascular lesions. There remains to be\ndiscussed the fulfilment of the greater indication for treatment:\nthe one which directs and governs the employment of the most\nimportant and successful of all the measures comprised in cardiac\ntherapeutics. This is the establishment and maintenance of\ncompensation. The nutrition and activity of the myocardium can be\nincreased and sustained by means of specific cardiac stimulants\nand tonics, such as strychnine, ammonia and the digitalis group of\ndrugs; by h\u00e6matinics, stomachics and laxatives to afford an abundant\nsupply of healthy blood; by insuring wholesome nervous influences,\none of the conditions of hypertrophy; and by the employment of the\nnon-medicinal measures now so extensively used to increase the\nvigour and benefit the metabolism of the cardiac walls, particularly\nactive and passive exercises and baths. This is a comprehensive\nstatement of the lines of treatment calculated to benefit more or\nless all the kinds of cardiac degeneration which I have had occasion\nto notice. Of the individual pathological changes, and the rational\ntreatment indicated for each from this point of view, I will refer\nto three only which will serve to illustrate the considerations\nwhich ought to guide us in practice.\n\nIn the subject of regular or irregular gout attention to the cause,\nthat is, to disordered metabolism of the body as a whole and of\nthe cardiac and arterial walls in particular, promotes, as we have\nseen, the recognised conditions of compensation: the etiological\nand pathological indications are here practically identical. In\nrespect of exercise in detail, gentle walking on the level should\nbe ordered to begin with, that is, exercise short of producing pain\nor oppression.

The profession\nought to remember (what the public cannot and probably never will\ncome to understand) that pathological diagnosis must precede\nrational treatment, which consists in applying a proper remedy\nto the individual case before us, not in fitting every case to a\nspecialised system or panacea--the essence of quackery.\n\nIn planning the treatment of the dilated heart of the\nmiddle-aged man who strained his circulation in youth and comes\nto us complaining of a recurrence of pr\u00e6cordial distress and\nbreathlessness, we have to remember that there is left in the\ncardiac walls but a portion of that reserve of elasticity and that\nreserve of muscular energy which they normally possess and require\nto enable them to meet the stress of exertion. Let me remind you for\na moment that, of the provisions which the heart possesses against\nsuch an emergency or other sudden or severe demand upon its capacity\nand activity, one is extensibility of its tissues, by virtue of\nwhich it accommodates within it the considerable increase in the\ncharge of blood that is poured into it from the active muscles, and\nthe residues that accumulate within it from insufficient discharge\nin the face of increased peripheral resistance. The walls yield\nbefore the increased internal pressure acting on them both _a\ntergo_ and _a fronte_; the heart is over-distended, with a passing\nsense of discomfort, dyspn\u0153a and lividity; and when the muscular\neffort is ended the elasticity corresponding with extensibility of\nthe walls presently insures the return of the chambers to their\noriginal dimensions. At the same time a second provision comes into\noperation. Increased muscular activity is developed in accurate\nproportion to the rise of internal pressure and secures sufficient\noutput from the heart. This, I repeat, is what occurs in the sound\nheart. Now, in old parietal strain extensibility and the reserve of\ncapacity of the chambers which it insures are seriously exhausted;\nwhilst the muscular function is only maintained by means of\nhypertrophy, to which there is necessarily a limit. In these cases\nof strain it is impossible to reduce the original dilatation--that\nis permanent. But we may and ought to be able to reduce the further\ndilatation, if any, that has been produced in connection with recent\nfailure of nutrition and fresh embarrassment. Therefore, whilst we\npromote the nutrition of the elastic and muscular structures of the\nmyocardium on the general principles which I have just laid down,\nwe must be distinctly sparing of our demands on them. Everything\napproaching effort must be forbidden at once and for a sufficient\ntime to rest and reinvigorate the cardiac tissues; whilst the\nnitrites or small doses of opium will also give relief and restore\nconfidence in attacks of palpitation and anxiety. \"Exercise, but\nnot exertion,\" will be the broad rule to follow, at any rate until\nit has been proved that greater effort can be made with safety and\nactual advantage. But if pr\u00e6cordial embarrassment be the result\nof the attempt, or of ordinary professional work, as occasionally\nhappens, further rest will have to be taken, that is, rest for hours\nor days, according to the severity of the symptoms.

I have already\nmentioned to you that middle-aged patients with cardiac strain,\ndating from their youth, occasionally break down in their work for\nmonths or even years. In such an event a thorough change of air\nand scene should be combined with rest as a method of treatment. A\nlong voyage may prove invaluable, or foreign travel of an easy and\ninteresting kind. These not only rest the heart, but they divert the\nmind and remove the curious nervousness or loss of courage which, as\nI have said, is developed occasionally in these subjects, previously\nso vigorous and confident.\n\nCompare with this line of treatment that which is indicated in acute\ncardiac strain after 40. The problem here is not how to deal with\na chronically dilated and hypertrophied heart, but with a heart\nwhich has just yielded during effort, mainly in consequence of\nthe nutritional impairment of its walls. It is not simply strain\nof a heart that had begun to be somewhat precariously nourished\nas a natural result of age; the probability is that the heart\nwas actually gouty in the comprehensive sense of the term, that\nis, irritated by uric acid and embarrassed by flatulence, both\nmechanically and reflexly; and, indeed, possibly it was damaged\nby the atheromatous process. Rest is essential at first in the\ntreatment of this type of case also; indeed, it is automatically\nsecured by the distress which accompanies attempts at movement.\nBut rest must not be carried too far, that is, it must not be\nof greater degree or duration than is absolutely necessary as\nindicated by the symptoms and signs, lest it aggravate the state\nof parietal mal-nutrition and promote fresh gout. At the same time\nthe diet must be controlled strictly or even severely on the lines\nthat I laid down for gout, lest the over-feeding which accompanies\nrest as a matter of thoughtless routine should have the same\nunfortunate effects. A course of treatment at some of the good home\nor Continental spas, with special precautions, is distinctly useful\nin senile strain, and the Nauheim methods have benefited more than\none case of the kind in my experience, the degree of dilatation\ndiminishing whilst the vigour of the heart increased. At the same\ntime cardiac tonics of a medicinal kind are administered judiciously.\n\nI am on the point of passing from the subject of the nutrition of\nthe myocardium, when it occurs to me that some of you might very\nnaturally ask me: What about fatty degeneration and the treatment\nof it? This is a question peculiarly interesting to me. I have not\ndwelt on fatty degeneration of the heart in these lectures, and yet\nI have mentioned it again and again.

Nothing could well bring home more fully to\nus the importance, indeed the necessity, of pursuing in practice the\nline of inquiry, prognosis and treatment which I have advocated in\nthese lectures--the etiological one. Let me ask you also to listen\nto a confession of one of the highest authorities on heart disease\nin this country. \"It is absolutely impossible,\" says Dr. George\nBalfour, \"to diagnosticate fatty degeneration of the heart; we may\nsurmise its existence, but we can only be certain of its presence\nwhen we see it _post mortem_\"; and he quotes Fraentzel of Berlin in\nsupport of his statement.[16] It must have occurred to many of you,\nas it has occurred to me, how seldom we diagnose fatty degeneration\nof the heart until after sudden death. How can we be expected to do\nso if we trust only to signs and symptoms, and overlook that which\nis the key to the diagnosis--the discovery of the cause that is at\nwork?\n\n  [16] Balfour, _op. cit._, p. 249.\n\nI have now sketched very broadly the rational treatment of these\ndisorders and diseases as far as the object of it is to prevent the\noccurrence or the extension of them, and to promote compensation of\nthe disabilities which they produce. It remains for me to notice,\nalso very briefly, the management of cardio-vascular degenerations\nwhen the heart fails, or when it appears to fail, and distress and\ndanger demand more direct and immediate attention. I have said\n\"when the heart appears to fail\" of set purpose. I am anxious to\ndirect your attention, if it be but for a moment, to the fact that\nin many instances where pr\u00e6cordial oppression, pain, palpitation\nand faintness, with frequent small irregular pulse, are significant\nof serious disturbance of the action of the heart, there is no\nfailure of the myocardium in the proper sense of the term, but only\nembarrassment of a temporary character. Do not conclude from this\nthat I regard the disturbance of the heart as of little account. I\nhave called it serious, for indeed the patient may perish of it.\nWhat I wish to maintain is that in cardiac degeneration of any\nkind, in chronic cardiac dilatation, and in the enlarged heart of\nBright's disease and of emphysema, just as in ordinary valvular\ndisease, attacks of distress, alarming both to patient and doctor,\noften occur which call for nothing more in the way of treatment than\nattention to some intercurrent influence--an indigestible meal,\nloaded bowels, a nervous shock, a thoughtless effort, a passing\nhardship or nervous strain. Digitalis and its allies, strychnine,\nalcohol, nitrites, iodides and the rest are out of place in such\nan event. Complete rest in bed, a carminative draught, calomel and\nsaline purgatives, spare and highly digestible diet, reassurance and\na little time are quite sufficient means of treatment.\n\nWhen true failure occurs, manifested by the familiar phenomena of\nresidual dilatation of the heart, mechanical congestion and dropsy,\na different set of measures are demanded.

Now is the time to attend\nwith expedition, energy and completeness to the fulfilment of the\nthree great therapeutical indications for the treatment of cardiac\nfailure: to reduce the peripheral resistance; to increase the vigour\nof ventricular contraction and rehabilitate hypertrophy; and to\nremove arrears of work in the form of residual blood in the cardiac\nchambers, mechanical congestion of the veins and viscera, and dropsy\nof the integuments and serous sacs. Bodily rest; a light, solid\ndiet, and a definite allowance of alcohol, if required; active\npurgation with mercurials, salines and jalap; and the exhibition of\nsufficiently large doses of digitalis or one of its congeners, in\ncombination with saline and other diuretics--these are the means\ncalculated to attain the desired objects. You will not expect\nme to enter into the many details of the management of cardiac\nfailure. It is not different in any important respect in the man\nof middle or advanced age with cardiac degeneration from what it\nis in an ordinary case of chronic valvular disease. Only on a few\npoints do I desire to dwell. First, that we must not be afraid to\npurge these patients, if necessary, every morning. Secondly, that\nwhen the appetite flags and flatulence occurs, instead of slops a\nblue pill or a dose of calomel should be given, and light solids\npersevered with. Third, that digitalis must be given freely, the\ndose of the tincture, for instance, being raised to 15 or even 20\nminims every four hours, if smaller doses, such as 7\u00bd or 10\nminims, fail. Unquestionably there is a disposition on the part of\nsome practitioners to pause or retrace their steps in the dosage of\nthis invaluable drug, alarmed by the irregularity, frequency and\nsmallness of the pulse. All these characters of the pulse call for\nmore digitalis, not for less. In this connection let me also say\nthat the most ready and accurate, because measurable, evidence of\nthe action of digitalis in cardiac failure is strangely disregarded\nin ordinary practice--I mean the volume of the renal secretion.\nWe may be in difficulty, and we may differ with each other, as to\nthe tension of the patient's pulse and the use of continuing or\nmodifying the digitalis treatment, when all that we have to do is\nto ascertain the exact degree of diuresis. Fourth, that nocturnal\nrestlessness and sleeplessness are to be met unhesitatingly with\npermission to spend the night in an easy chair by the bedside.\nFifth, that, according to my experience, acupuncture and drainage\nsucceed perfectly in these senile cases with dropsy, as much as 10\npints or more of serum escaping in the course of 24 hours, to the\ncomplete and often lasting relief of the circulation.\n\nAnd now I must bring these lectures to a close.

C\u2019est un examen sans danger qui n\u2019est pas douloureux. Il peut \u00eatre fait au cabinet du cardiologue, \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital, voire au domicile.\n\nDes \u00e9lectrodes adh\u00e9sives reli\u00e9es \u00e0 des c\u00e2bles sont pos\u00e9es sur la peau nue (ce qui oblige, en cas de pilosit\u00e9 importante, \u00e0 raser certains endroits du torse). Elles captent les champs \u00e9lectriques cr\u00e9\u00e9s par le c\u0153ur.\n\nFaire un ECG exige de poser au moins six \u00e9lectrodes (parfois moins pour une \u00e9preuve d\u2019effort), mais il n\u2019est pas rare que davantage soient pos\u00e9es : douze, quinze, voire dix-huit, lorsque le cardiologue souhaite avoir une analyse tridimensionnelle de l\u2019activit\u00e9 \u00e9lectrique du c\u0153ur (pour distinguer le fonctionnement de chaque cavit\u00e9).\n\nLes \u00e9lectrodes sont pos\u00e9es au niveau des poignets et des chevilles, ainsi que sur des points d\u00e9finis du thorax (de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 du sternum, dans les espaces entre certaines c\u00f4tes, etc.).

Il existe des logiciels pouvant aider \u00e0 l\u2019analyse, mais ils ne peuvent se substituer \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience du m\u00e9decin. Le m\u00e9decin se sert de l\u2019ECG comme un outil parmi d'autres, qui n\u2019a de sens que dans le contexte clinique du patient. Un ECG normal ne signifie pas l\u2019absence de maladie cardiaque et un ECG anormal peut tout \u00e0 fait \u00eatre sans gravit\u00e9.\n\nUn battement cardiaque normal laisse une trace typique sur l\u2019\u00e9lectrocardiogramme, trace constitu\u00e9e d\u2019 \u00ab ondes \u00bb :\n\nCette s\u00e9quence de signaux s\u2019interpr\u00e8te de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\n\nl\u2019onde P repr\u00e9sente la contraction des oreillettes ;\nl\u2019espace entre P et Q mesure le temps que met l'influx nerveux pour aller des oreillettes aux ventricules. Au repos, sa dur\u00e9e normale est de 0,12 \u00e0 0,20 seconde, elle diminue lorsque la fr\u00e9quence cardiaque augmente.\nle \u00ab complexe QRS \u00bb correspond \u00e0 la contraction des ventricules. Sa dur\u00e9e est habituellement inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 0,11 s.\nle segment ST traduit la fin de la contraction des ventricules\nl\u2019onde T est due \u00e0 la relaxation des ventricules en fin de contraction et le retour du c\u0153ur \u00e0 un \u00e9tat propice \u00e0 une nouvelle contraction (le signal correspondant \u00e0 la relaxation des oreillettes est cach\u00e9 par le complexe QRS).\nLes principales mesures que le cardiologue effectue lors de l'analyse d'un ECG sont celles de l'onde P, de l'espace PR, du complexe QRS, de l'espace QT, du segment ST et enfin de l'onde T. Il mesure la dur\u00e9e et l\u2019amplitude de chaque onde et le temps \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre les diff\u00e9rents phases de la contraction. Par exemple, la mesure du temps \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre deux points R successifs permet de calculer la fr\u00e9quence cardiaque et de rep\u00e9rer un rythme irr\u00e9gulier.\nLe trac\u00e9 de l\u2019ECG permet \u00e9galement au cardiologue de calculer l\u2019 \u00ab axe \u00e9lectrique \u00bb du c\u0153ur. La mesure de cet axe \u00e9lectrique permet de d\u00e9pister des probl\u00e8mes au niveau des valvules (du c\u0153ur ou de l\u2019aorte), des troubles de la conduction nerveuse dans une partie du c\u0153ur, des complications de l\u2019hypertension art\u00e9rielle ou d\u2019une mauvaise circulation du sang dans les poumons, par exemple.\n\nQU'EST-CE QUE LE HOLTER ?\nLe holter, ou enregistrement en ambulatoire, est un dispositif portable permettant l'enregistrement en", "doc_id": "237d4b1d-fbc8-4895-afd9-f40ea1a3a9b0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ebf8e910ef64737efff767d1f47ad77566637f0fceccc9cc8ff1314a8bb42843", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 4937, "end": 7795}, "relationships": {"1": "54e62691-0fa0-4ab8-b2e5-de75f74a0fda", "2": "7e558935-b1d1-487f-9c51-0a2d247dd8a7", "3": "bf620139-0494-4371-9e64-b44a5d66d545"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf620139-0494-4371-9e64-b44a5d66d545": {"__data__": {"text": "trac\u00e9 de l\u2019ECG permet \u00e9galement au cardiologue de calculer l\u2019 \u00ab axe \u00e9lectrique \u00bb du c\u0153ur.

Il est mis en place par le cardiologue : cinq ou six \u00e9lectrodes sont coll\u00e9es sur la poitrine et sont connect\u00e9es \u00e0 un bo\u00eetier d'un poids de 150 \u00e0 250 grammes port\u00e9 \u00e0 la ceinture. R\u00e9cemment sont apparus des holters ayant une capacit\u00e9 de plusieurs semaines et qui peuvent \u00eatre port\u00e9s en pendentif autour du cou, avec des c\u00e2bles tr\u00e8s courts.\n\nPendant la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019enregistrement, il faut \u00e9viter les bains et les douches, l'eau pouvant abimer le bo\u00eetier et d\u00e9coller les \u00e9lectrodes. Par ailleurs, le patient tient un journal avec ses p\u00e9riodes d\u2019activit\u00e9 et de repos, ainsi que les sympt\u00f4mes \u00e9ventuellement ressentis avec les heures correspondantes.

They may also cause chest pain, a faint feeling, fatigue, or hyperventilation after exercise.Symptoms may be more pronounced at times of stress.

Several diseases and conditions fall under the umbrella of heart disease. Types of heart disease include:\n\nArrhythmia. An arrhythmia is a heart rhythm abnormality.\nAtherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a hardening of the arteries.\nCardiomyopathy. This condition causes the heart\u2019s muscles to harden or grow weak.\nCongenital heart defects. Congenital heart defects are heart irregularities that are present at birth.\nCoronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is caused by the buildup of plaque in the heart\u2019s arteries. It\u2019s sometimes called ischemic heart disease.\nHeart infections. Heart infections may be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites.\nThe term cardiovascular disease may be used to refer to heart conditions that specifically affect the blood vessels.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of heart disease?\nDifferent types of heart disease may result in a variety of different symptoms.\n\nArrhythmias\nArrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms. The symptoms you experience may depend on the type of arrhythmia you have \u2014 heartbeats that are too fast or too slow. Symptoms of an arrhythmia include:\n\nlightheadedness\nfluttering heart or racing heartbeat\nslow pulse\nfainting spells\ndizziness\nchest pain\nAtherosclerosis\nAtherosclerosis reduces blood supply to your extremities. In addition to chest pain and shortness of breath, symptoms of atherosclerosis include:\n\ncoldness, especially in the limbs\nnumbness, especially in the limbs\nunusual or unexplained pain\nweakness in your legs and arms\nCongenital heart defects\nCongenital heart defects are heart problems that develop when a fetus is growing. Some heart defects are never diagnosed. Others may be found when they cause symptoms, such as:\n\nblue-tinged skin\nswelling of the extremities\nshortness of breath or difficulty breathing\nfatigue and low energy\nirregular heart rhythm\nCoronary artery disease (CAD)\nCAD is plaque buildup in the arteries that move oxygen-rich blood through the heart and lungs. Symptoms of CAD include:\n\nchest pain or discomfort\na feeling of pressure or squeezing in the chest\nshortness of breath\nnausea\nfeelings of indigestion or gas\nCardiomyopathy\nCardiomyopathy is a disease that causes the muscles of the heart to grow larger and turn rigid, thick, or weak. Symptoms of this condition include:\n\nfatigue\nbloating\nswollen legs, especially ankles and feet\nshortness of breath\npounding or rapid pulse\nHeart infections\nThe term heart infection may be used to describe conditions such as endocarditis or myocarditis. Symptoms of a heart infection include:\n\nchest pain\nchest congestion or coughing\nfever\nchills\nskin rash\nRead more about the signs and symptoms of heart disease.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of heart disease in women?\nWomen often experience different signs and symptoms of heart disease than men, specifically with regards to CAD and other cardiovascular diseases.\n\nIn fact, a 2003 study looked at the symptoms most often seen in women who\u2019d experienced a heart attack. The top symptoms didn\u2019t include \u201cclassic\u201d heart attack symptoms such as chest pain and tingling.

Each type of heart disease is caused by something entirely unique to that condition. Atherosclerosis and CAD result from plaque buildup in the arteries. Other causes of heart disease are described below.\n\nArrhythmia causes\nCauses of an abnormal heart rhythm include:\n\ndiabetes\nCAD\nheart defects, including congenital heart defects\nmedications, supplements, and herbal remedies\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension)\nexcessive alcohol or caffeine use\nsubstance use disorders\nstress and anxiety\nexisting heart damage or disease\nCongenital heart defect causes\nThis heart disease occurs while a baby is still developing in the womb. Some heart defects may be serious and diagnosed and treated early. Some may also go undiagnosed for many years.\n\nYour heart\u2019s structure can also change as you age. This can create a heart defect that may lead to complications and problems.\n\nCardiomyopathy causes\nSeveral types of cardiomyopathy exist. Each type is the result of a separate condition.\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy. It\u2019s unclear what causes this most commonTrusted Source type of cardiomyopathy, which leads to a weakened heart. It may be the result of previous damage to the heart, such as the kind caused by drugs, infections, and heart attack. It may also be an inherited condition or the result of uncontrolled blood pressure.\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This type of heart disease leads to a thicker heart muscle. It\u2019s usually inherited.\nRestrictive cardiomyopathy. It\u2019s often unclear what leads to this type of cardiomyopathy, which results in rigid heart walls. Possible causes may include scar tissue buildup and a type of abnormal protein buildup known as amyloidosis.\nHeart infection causes\nBacteria, parasites, and viruses are the most common causes of heart infections. Uncontrolled infections in the body can also harm the heart if they\u2019re not properly treated.\n\nWhat are some risk factors for heart disease?\nThere are many risk factors for heart disease. Some are controllable, and others aren\u2019t. The CDC says that around 47 percentTrusted Source of Americans have at least one risk factor for heart disease. Some of these risk factors include:\n\nhigh blood pressure\nhigh cholesterol and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol\nsmoking\nobesity\nphysical inactivity\nSmoking, for example, is a controllable risk factor.

People who smoke double their risk of developing heart disease, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)Trusted Source.\n\nPeople with diabetes may also be at higher risk for heart disease because high blood glucose levels increase the risk of:\n\nangina\nheart attack\nstroke\nCAD\nIf you have diabetes, it\u2019s essential to control your glucose to limit your risk for developing heart disease. The American Heart Association (AHA)Trusted Source reports that people who have both high blood pressure and diabetes double their risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\nRisk factors you can\u2019t control\nOther risk factors for heart disease include:\n\nfamily history\nethnicity\nsex\nage\nAlthough these risk factors aren\u2019t controllable, you may be able to monitor their effects. According to the Mayo Clinic, a family history of CAD is especially concerning if it involved a:\n\nmale relative under 55 years old, such as a father or brother\nfemale relative under 65 years old, such as a mother or sister\nNon-Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic whites, and people of Asian or Pacific Island heritage have a higher risk than Native Alaskans or Native Americans. Also, men are at greater risk for heart disease than women. In fact, the CDC estimates between 70 and 89 percent of all cardiac events in the United States occur in men.\n\nFinally, your age can increase your risk for heart disease. From ages 20 to 59, men and women are at a similar risk for CAD. After age 60, however, the percentage of men affected rises to between 19.9 and 32.2 percent. Only 9.7 to 18.8 percent of women that age are affected.\n\nLearn more about risk factors for CAD.\n\nHow is heart disease diagnosed?\nYour doctor may order several types of tests and evaluations to make a heart disease diagnosis. Some of these tests can be performed before you ever show signs of heart disease. Others may be used to look for possible causes of symptoms when they develop.\n\nPhysical exams and blood tests\nThe first thing your doctor will do is perform a physical exam and take an account of the symptoms you\u2019ve been experiencing. Then they\u2019ll want to know your family and personal medical history. Genetics can play a role in some heart diseases. If you have a close family member with heart disease, share this information with your doctor.\n\nBlood tests are frequently ordered. This is because they can help your doctor see your cholesterol levels and look for signs of inflammation.\n\nNoninvasive tests\nA variety of noninvasive tests may be used to diagnose heart disease.\n\nElectrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This test can monitor your heart\u2019s electrical activity and help your doctor spot any irregularities.\nEchocardiogram. This ultrasound test can give your doctor a close picture of your heart\u2019s structure.\nStress test. This exam is performed while you complete a strenuous activity, such as walking, running, or riding a stationary bike. During the test, your doctor can monitor your heart\u2019s activity in response to changes in physical exertion.\nCarotid ultrasound. To get a detailed ultrasound of your carotid arteries, your doctor may order this ultrasound test.\nHolter monitor. Your doctor may ask you to wear this heart rate monitor for 24 to 48 hours. It allows them to get an extended view of your heart\u2019s activity.\nTilt table test. If you\u2019ve recently experienced fainting or lightheadedness when standing up or sitting down, your doctor may order this test.

This imaging test gives your doctor a highly-detailed X-ray image of your heart.\nHeart MRI. Like a CT scan, a heart MRI can provide a very detailed image of your heart and blood vessels.\nInvasive tests\nIf a physical exam, blood tests, and noninvasive tests aren\u2019t conclusive, your doctor may want to look inside your body to determine what\u2019s causing any unusual symptoms. Invasive tests may include:\n\nCardiac catheterization and coronary angiography. Your doctor may insert a catheter into your heart through the groin and arteries. The catheter will help them perform tests involving the heart and blood vessels. Once this catheter is in your heart, your doctor can perform a coronary angiography. During a coronary angiography, a dye is injected into the delicate arteries and capillaries surrounding the heart. The dye helps produce a highly detailed X-ray image.\nElectrophysiology study. During this test, your doctor may attach electrodes to your heart through a catheter. When the electrodes are in place, your doctor can send electric pulses through and record how the heart responds.\nRead more about the tests that are used to diagnose heart disease.\n\nWhat treatments are available for heart disease?\nTreatment for heart disease largely depends on the type of heart disease you have as well as how far it has advanced. For example, if you have a heart infection, your doctor is likely to prescribe an antibiotic.\n\nIf you have plaque buildup, they may take a two-pronged approach: prescribe a medication that can help lower your risk for additional plaque buildup and look to help you adopt healthy lifestyle changes.\n\nTreatment for heart disease falls into three main categories:\n\nLifestyle changes\nHealthy lifestyle choices can help you prevent heart disease. They can also help you treat the condition and prevent it from getting worse. Your diet is one of the first areas you may seek to change.\n\nA low-sodium, low-fat diet that\u2019s rich in fruits and vegetables may help you lower your risk for heart disease complications. One example is the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet.\n\nLikewise, getting regular exercise and quitting tobacco can help treat heart disease. Also look to reduce your alcohol consumption.\n\nMedications\nA medication may be necessary to treat certain types of heart disease. Your doctor can prescribe a medication that can either cure or control your heart disease. Medications may also be prescribed to slow or stop the risk for complications. The exact drug you\u2019re prescribed depends on the type of heart disease you have. Read more about the drugs that may be prescribed to treat heart disease.\n\nSurgery or invasive procedures\nIn some cases of heart disease, surgery or a medical procedure is necessary to treat the condition and prevent worsening symptoms.\n\nFor example, if you have arteries that are blocked entirely or almost completely by plaque buildup, your doctor may insert a stent in your artery to return regular blood flow.

The procedure your doctor will perform depends on the type of heart disease you have and the extent of damage to your heart.\n\nHow can I prevent heart disease?\nSome risk factors for heart disease can\u2019t be controlled, like your family history, for example. But it\u2019s still important to lower your chance of developing heart disease by decreasing the risk factors that you can control.\n\nAim for healthy blood pressure and cholesterol numbers\nHaving healthy blood pressure and cholesterol ranges are some of the first steps you can take for a healthy heart. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). A healthy blood pressure is considered less than 120 systolic and 80 diastolic, which is often expressed as \u201c120 over 80\u201d or \u201c120/80 mm Hg.\u201d Systolic is the measurement of pressure while the heart is contracting. Diastolic is the measurement when the heart is resting. Higher numbers indicate that the heart is working too hard to pump blood.\n\nYour ideal cholesterol level will depend on your risk factors and heart health history. If you\u2019re at a high risk of heart disease, have diabetes, or have already had a heart attack, your target levels will be below those of people with low or average risk.\n\nFind ways to manage stress\nAs simple as it sounds, managing stress can also lower your risk for heart disease. Don\u2019t underestimate chronic stress as a contributor to heart disease. Speak with your doctor if you\u2019re frequently overwhelmed, anxious, or are coping with stressful life events, such as moving, changing jobs, or going through a divorce.\n\nEmbrace a healthier lifestyle\nEating healthy foods and exercising regularly are also important. Make sure to avoid foods high in saturated fat and salt. Doctors recommend 30 to 60 minutes of exerciseTrusted Source on most days for a total of 2 hours and 30 minutes each week. Check with your doctor to make sure you can safely meet these guidelines, especially if you already have a heart condition.\n\nIf you smoke, stop. The nicotine in cigarettes causes blood vessels to constrict, making it harder for oxygenated blood to circulate. This can lead to atherosclerosis.\n\nLearn more about ways you can lower your risk for and possibly prevent heart disease.\n\nWhat lifestyle changes does heart disease require?\nIf you\u2019ve recently received a heart disease diagnosis, talk to your doctor about steps you can take to stay as healthy as possible. You can prepare for your appointment by creating a detailed list of your everyday habits. Possible topics include:\n\nmedications you take\nyour regular exercise routine\nyour typical diet\nany family history of heart disease or stroke\npersonal history of high blood pressure or diabetes\nany symptoms you\u2019re experiencing, such as a racing heart, dizziness, or lack of energy\nSeeing your doctor regularly is just one lifestyle habit you can take up. If you do, any potential issues can be caught as early as possible. Certain risk factors, such as high blood pressure, may be addressed with medications to lower your risk of heart disease.\n\nYour doctor may also provide tips for:\n\nquitting smoking\ncontrolling blood pressure\nexercising regularly\nmaintaining healthy cholesterol levels\nlosing weight if you\u2019re overweight\neating healthy\nMaking these changes all at once might not be possible.

Hypertension requires your heart to pump harder in order to circulate your blood through your body. This increased pressure can lead to several types of heart problems, including a thick, enlarged heart muscle and narrowed arteries.\n\nThe extra force your heart must use to pump blood can make your heart muscles harder and thicker. This can impact how well your heart pumps. Hypertensive heart disease can make arteries less elastic and more rigid. That can slow blood circulation and prevent your body from getting the oxygen-rich blood it needs.\n\nHypertensive heart disease is the top cause of death for people with high blood pressure, so it\u2019s important you begin to treat high blood pressure as soon as you can. Treatment can stop complications and possibly prevent additional damage.\n\nRead more about hypertensive heart disease.\n\nIs there a cure for heart disease?\nHeart disease can\u2019t be cured or reversed. It requires a lifetime of treatment and careful monitoring. Many of the symptoms of heart disease can be relieved with medications, procedures, and lifestyle changes. When these methods fail, coronary intervention or bypass surgery might be used.\n\nIf you believe you may be experiencing symptoms of heart disease or if you have risk factors for heart disease, make an appointment to see your doctor.

Lewis\n[Footnote: Lewis: Lecture in the Harvey Society, New York Academy of\nMedicine, Oct. 31, 1914.] describes this bundle as from 2 to 3 cm.\nin length, its upper end being continuous with the muscle fibers of\nthe wall of the superior vena cava. Its lower end is continuous with\nthe muscle fibers of the right auricle. From this node \"the\nexcitation wave is conducted radially along the muscular strands at\na uniform rate of about a thousand millimeters per second to all\nportions of the auricular musculature.\"\n\nThough a wonderfully tireless mechanism, this region may fall out of\nadjustment, and the stimuli proceeding from it may not be normal or\nact normally. It has been shown recently not only that there must be\nperfection of muscle, nerve and heart circulation but also that the\nvarious elements in solution in the blood must be in perfect amounts\nand relationship to each other for the heart stimulation to be\nnormal. It has also been shown that if for any reason this region of\nthe right auricle is disturbed, a stimulus or impulse might come\nfrom some other part of the auricle, or even from the ventricle, or\nfrom some point between them. Such stimulations may constitute\nauricular, ventricular or auriculoventricular extra contractions or\nextrasystoles, as they are termed. In the last few years it has been\ndiscovered that the auriculoventricular handle, or \"bundle of His,\"\nhas a necessary function of conductivity of auricular impulse to\nventricular contraction. A temporary disturbance of this\nconductivity will cause a heart block, an intermittent disturbance\nwill cause intermittent heart block (Stokes-Adams disease), and a\nprolonged disturbance, death. It has also been shown that\nextrasystoles, meaning irregular heart action, may be caused by\nimpulses originating at the apex, at the base or at some point in\nthe right ventricle.\n\nIn the ventricles, Lewis states, the Purkinje fibers act as the\nconducting agent, stimuli being conducted to all portions of the\nendocardium simultaneously at a rate of from 2,000 to 1,000 mm. per\nsecond. The ventricular muscle also aids in the conduction of the\nstimuli, but at a slower rate, 300 mm. per minute. The rate of\nconduction, Lewis believes, depends on the glycogen content of the\nstructures, the Purkinje fibers, where conduction is most rapid,\ncontaining the largest amount of glycogen, the auricular musculature\ncontaining the next largest amount of glycogen, and the ventricular\nmuscle fibers the least amount of glycogen.\n\nAnatomists and histologists have more perfectly demonstrated the\nmuscle fibers of the heart and the structure at and around the\nvalves; the physiologic chemists have shown more clearly the action\nof drugs, metals and organic solutions on the heart; and the\nphysiologists and clinicians with laboratory facilities have\ndemonstrated by various new apparatus the action of the heart and\nthe circulatory power under various conditions.

It is not now\nsufficient to state that the heart is acting irregularly, or that\nthe pulse is irregular; the endeavor should be to determine whit\ncauses the irregularity, and what kind of irregularity is present.\n\n\nCLINICAL INTERPRETATION OF PULSE TRACINGS\n\nA moment may be spent on clinical interpretation of pulse tracings.\nIt has recently been shown that the permanently irregular pulse is\ndue to fibrillary contraction, or really auricular fibrillation--in\nother words, irregular stimuli proceeding from the auricle--and that\nsuch an irregular pulse is not due to disturbance at the\nauriculoventricular node, as believed a short time ago. These little\nirregular stimuli proceeding from the auricle reach the\nauriculoventricular node and are transmitted to the ventricle as\nrapidly as the ventricle is able to react. Such rapid stimuli may\nsoon cause death; or, if for any reason, medicinal or otherwise, the\nventricle becomes indifferent to these stimuli, it may not take note\nof more than a certain portion of the stimuli. It then acts slowly\nenough to allow prolongation of life, and even considerable\nactivity. If such a heart becomes more rapid from such stimuli, 110\nor more, for any length of time, the condition becomes very serious.\nDigitalis in such a condition is, of course, of supreme value on\naccount of its ability to slow the heart. Such irregularity perhaps\nmost frequently occurs with valvular disease, especially mitral\nstenosis and in the muscular degenerations of senility, as fibrosis.\n\nAtropin has been used to differentiate functional heart block from\nthat produced by a lesion. Hart [Footnote: Hart: Am. Jour. Med. Sc.,\n1915, cxlix, 62.] has used atropin in three different types of heart\nblock. In the first the heart block is induced by digitalis. This\nwas entirely removed by atropin. In the second type, where there was\nnormal auricular activity, but where the ventricular contractions\nwere decreased, atropin affected an increase in the number of\nventricular contractions, but did not completely remove the heart\nblock. He adopted atropin where the heart block was associated with\nauricular fibrillation. The number of ventricular contractions was\nincreased, but not enough to indicate the complete removal of the\nheart block.\n\nLewis [Footnote: Lewis: Brit. Med. Jour., 1909, ii, 1528.] believes\nthat 50 percent of cardiac arrhythmia originates in muscle\ndisturbance or incoordination in the auricle. These stimuli are\nirregular in intensity, and the contractions caused are irregular in\ndegree. If the wave lengths of the pulse tracing show no regularity-\n-if, in fact, hardly two adjacent wave lengths are alike--the\ndisturbance is auricular fibrillation. Injury to the auricle, or\npressure for any reason on the auricle, may so disturb the\ntransmission of stimuli and contractions that the contractions of\nthe ventricle are very much fewer than the stimuli proceeding from\nthe auricle. In other words, a form of heart block may occur.\nVarious stimuli coming through the pneumogastric nerves, either from\nabove or from the peripheral endings in the stomach or intestines,\nmay inhibit or slow the ventricular contractions. It seems to have\nbeen again shown, as was earlier understood, that there are\ninhibitory and accelerator ganglia in the heart itself, each subject\nto various kinds of stimulation and various", "doc_id": "c25fbf7a-3f19-42c0-b75b-19c78a2504dc", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8ee73e256a073fb52c06e62915f5c89f1edaab6adc0351fcba2944a88bca889a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 24391, "end": 28246}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "14f6fb8b-6c25-4a8f-a94f-b192421c5e6a", "3": "d9afedaa-b7f7-441e-b537-60f6cc4673f2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9afedaa-b7f7-441e-b537-60f6cc4673f2": {"__data__": {"text": "in fact, hardly two adjacent wave lengths are alike--the\ndisturbance is auricular fibrillation.

It seems to have\nbeen again shown, as was earlier understood, that there are\ninhibitory and accelerator ganglia in the heart itself, each subject\nto various kinds of stimulation and various kinds of depression.\n\nBoth auricular fibrillation and auricular flutter are best shown by\nthe polygraph and the electrocardiograph. The former is more exact\nas to details. Auricular flutter, which has also been called\nauricular tachysystole, is more common that is supposed. It consists\nof rapid coordinate auricular contractions, varying from 200 to 300\nper minute. Fulton [Footnote: Fulton, F. T.: \"Auricular Flutter,\"\nwith a Report of Two Cases, Arch. Int. Med., October, 1913, p. 475.]\nfinds in this condition that the initial stimulus arises in some\npart of the auricular musculature other than the sinus node. It is\ndifferent from paroxysmal tachycardia, in which the heart rate\nrarely exceeds 180 per minute. In auricular flutter there is always\npresent a certain amount of heart block, not all the stimuli\nreaching the ventricle. There may be a ratio of auricular\ncontractions to ventricular contractions, according to Fulton, of\n2:1, 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1, the 2:1 ratio being most common.\n\nOf course it is generally understood that children have a higher\npulse rate than adults; that women normally have a higher pulse rate\nthan men at the same age; that strenuous muscular exercise,\nfrequently repeated, without cardiac tire while causing the pulse to\nbe rapid at the time, slows the pulse during the interim of such\nexercise and may gradually cause a more or less permanent slow\npulse. It should be remembered that athletes have slow pulse, and\nthe severity of their condition must not be interpreted by the rate\nof the pulse. Even with high fever the pulse of an athlete may be\nslow.\n\nNot enough investigations have been made of the rate of the pulse\nduring sleep under various conditions. Klewitz [Footnote: Klewitz:\nDeutsch. Arch. f. klin. Med. 1913, cxii, 38.] found that the average\npulse rate of normal individuals while awake and active was 74 per\nminute, but while asleep the average fell to 59 per minute. He found\nalso that if a state of perfect rest could be obtained during the\nwaking period, the pulse rate was slowed. This is also true in cases\nof compensated cardiac lesions, but it was not true in decompensated\nhearts. He found that irregularities such as extrasystoles and\norganic tachycardia did not disappear during sleep, whereas\nfunctional tachycardia did.\n\nIt is well known that high blood pressure slows the pulse rate; that\nlow blood pressure generally increases the pulse rate, and that\narteriosclerosis, or the gradual aging of the arteries, slows the\npulse, except when the cardiac degeneration of old age makes the\nheart again more irritable and more rapid. The rapid heart in\nhyperthyroidism is also well understood. It is not so frequently\nnoted that hypersecretion of the thyroid may cause a rapid heart\nwithout any other tangible or discoverable thyroid symptom or\nsymptoms of hyperthyroidism. Bile in the blood almost always slows\nthe pulse.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION OF TRACINGS\n\nThe interpretation of the arterial tracing shows that the nearly\nvertical tip-stroke is due to", "doc_id": "d9afedaa-b7f7-441e-b537-60f6cc4673f2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c102b8c3aedf5d4e77c02b33128d9e098eb5bd2b4e31b3baa647775e5fb7efff", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 28250, "end": 32009}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "c25fbf7a-3f19-42c0-b75b-19c78a2504dc", "3": "d129488c-dfe8-4faf-aa49-2fd7e525710a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d129488c-dfe8-4faf-aa49-2fd7e525710a": {"__data__": {"text": "tachycardia did.\n\nIt is well known that high blood pressure slows the pulse rate; that\nlow blood pressure generally increases the pulse rate, and that\narteriosclerosis, or the gradual aging of the arteries, slows the\npulse, except when the cardiac degeneration of old age makes the\nheart again more irritable and more rapid.

It is not so frequently\nnoted that hypersecretion of the thyroid may cause a rapid heart\nwithout any other tangible or discoverable thyroid symptom or\nsymptoms of hyperthyroidism. Bile in the blood almost always slows\nthe pulse.\n\n\nINTERPRETATION OF TRACINGS\n\nThe interpretation of the arterial tracing shows that the nearly\nvertical tip-stroke is due to the sudden rise of blood pressure\ncaused by the contraction of the ventricles. The long and irregular\ndown-stroke means a gradual fall of the blood pressure. The first\nupward rise in this gradual decline is due to the secondary\ncontraction and expansion of the artery; in other words, a tidal\nwave. The second upward rise in the decline is called the recoil, or\nthe dicrotic wave, and is due to the sudden closure of the aortic\nvalves and the recoil of the blood wave. The interpretation of the\njugular tracing, or phlebogram as the vein tracing may be termed,\nshows the apex of the rise to be due to the contraction of the\nauricle. The short downward curve from the apex means relaxation of\nthe auricle. The second lesser rise, called the carotid wave, is\nbelieved to be due to the impact of the sudden expansion of the\ncarotid artery. The drop of the wave tracing after this cartoid rise\nis due to the auricular diastole. The immediate following second\nrise not so high as that of the auricular contraction is known as\nthe ventricular wave, and corresponds to the dicrotic wave in the\nradial. The next lesser decline shows ventricular diastole, or the\nheart rest. A tracing of the jugular vein shows the activity of the\nright side of the heart. The tracing of the carotid and radial shows\nthe activity of the left side of the heart. After normal tracings\nhave been carefully taken and studied by the clinician or a\nlaboratory assistant, abnormalities in these readings are readily\nshown graphically. Especially characteristic are tracings of\nauricular fibrillation and those of heart block.\n\n\nTESTS OF HEART STRENGTH\n\nIf both systolic and diastolic blood pressure are taken, and the\nheart strength is more or less accurately determined, mistakes in\nthe administration of cardiac drugs will be less frequent. Besides\nmapping out the size of the heart by roentgenoscopy and studying the\ncontractions of the heart with the fluoroscope, and a detailed study\nof sphygmographic and cardiographic tracings, which methods are not\navailable to the large majority of physicians, there are various\nmethods of approximately, at least, determining the strength of the\nheart muscle.\n\nBarringer [Footnote: Barringer, T. B., Jr.: The Circulatory Reaction\nto Graduated Work as a Test of the Heart's Functional Capacity,\nArch. Int. Med., March, 1916, p. 363.] has experimented both with\nnormal persons and with patients who were suffering some cardiac\ninsufficiency. He used both the bicycle ergometer and dumb-bells,\nand finds that there is a rise of systolic pressure after ordinary\nwork, but a delayed rise after very heavy work, in normal persons.\nIn patients with cardiac insufficiency he finds there is a delayed\nrise in the systolic pressure after even slight exercise, and those\nwith marked cardiac insufficiency have even a lowering of blood\npressure from the ordinary level. They all have increase in pulse\nrate.

He used both the bicycle ergometer and dumb-bells,\nand finds that there is a rise of systolic pressure after ordinary\nwork, but a delayed rise after very heavy work, in normal persons.\nIn patients with cardiac insufficiency he finds there is a delayed\nrise in the systolic pressure after even slight exercise, and those\nwith marked cardiac insufficiency have even a lowering of blood\npressure from the ordinary level. They all have increase in pulse\nrate. He quotes several authorities as showing that during muscle\nwork the carbon dioxid of the blood is increased in amount, which,\nstimulating the nervous centers controlling the suprarenal glands,\nincreases the epinephrin content of the blood. The consequence is\ncontraction of the splanchnic blood vessels, with a rise in general\nblood pressure. Also, the quickened action of the heart increases\nthe blood pressure. After a rest from the exercise, the extra amount\nof carbon dioxid is eliminated from the blood, the suprarenal glands\ndecrease their activity, and the blood pressure falls.\n\nNicolai and Zuntz [Footnote: Nicolai anal Zuntz: Berl. klin.\nWehnschr., May 4, 1914, p. 821.] have shown that with the first\nstrain of heavy work the heart increases in size, but it soon\nbecomes normal, or even smaller, as it more strenuously contracts,\nand the cavities of the heart will be completely emptied at each\nsystole. If the work is too heavy, and the systolic blood pressure\nis rapidly increased, it may become so great as to prevent the left\nventricle from completely evacuating its content. The heart then\nincreases in size and may sooner or later become strained; if this\nstrain is severe, an acute dilatation may of course occur, even in\nan otherwise well person. Such instances are not infrequent. A heart\nwhich is already enlarged or slightly dilated and insufficient,\nunder the stress of muscular labor will more slowly increase its\nforcefulness, and we have the delayed rise in systolic pressure.\n\nBarringer concludes that:\n\nThe pulse rate and the blood pressure reaction to graduated work is\na valid test of the heart's functional capacity. If the systolic\npressure reaches its greatest height not immediately after work, but\nfrom thirty to 120 seconds later, or if the pressure immediately\nafter work is lower than the original level, that work, whatever its\namount, has overtaxed the heart's functional capacity and may be\ntaken as an accurate measure of the heart's sufficiency.\n\nIn another article, Barringer [Footnote: Barringer, T. B., Jr.:\nStudies of the Heart's Functional Capacity as Estimated by the\nCirculatory Reaction to Graduated Work, Arch. Int. Med., May, 1916,\np. 670.] advises the use of a 5-pound dumb-bell extended upward from\nthe shoulder for 2 feet. Each such extension represents 10 foot-\npounds of work, although the exertion of holding the dumb-bell\nduring the nonextension period is not estimated. He believes that if\ncirculatory tire is shown with less than 100 foot-pounds per minute\nexercise, other signs of cardiac insufficiency will be in evidence.\nHe also believes that these foot-pound tests can be made to\ndetermine whether a patient should be up and about, and also that\nsuch graded exercise will increase the heart strength in cardiac\ninsufficiency.\n\nSchoonmaker, [Footnote: Schoonmaker: Am.

Such slight\nexercise should not cause any subjective symptoms, either dyspnea,\npalpitation or chest pain. If the heart muscle is in good condition,\nthe systolic pressure should remain the same after this slight\nexertion and these changes in posture. When the heart is good, there\nmay be slight increased pressure when the patient is standing. If,\nafter this slight exercise in the erect posture, the systolic\npressure is diminished, the heart muscle is defective.\n\nMartinet [Footnote: Martinet: Presse med., Jan. 20, 1916.] tests the\nheart strength as follows: He counts the pulse until for two\nsuccessive minutes there is the same number of beats, first when the\npatient is lying down, and then when he is standing. He also takes\nthe systolic and diastolic pressures at the same time. He then\ncauses the person to bend rapidly at the knees twenty times. The\npulse rate and the blood pressure are then taken each minute for\nfrom three to five minutes. The person then reclines, and the pulse\nand pressure are again recorded, Martinet says that an examination\nof these records in the form of a chart gives a graphic\ndemonstration of the heart strength. If the heart is weak, there are\nlikely to be asystoles, and tachycardia may occur, or a lowered\nblood pressure.\n\nRehfisch [Footnote: Rehfisch: Berl. klin. Wehnsehr., Nov. 29, 1915]\nstates that when a healthy person takes even slight exercise, the\naortic closure becomes louder than the second pulmonic sound,\nshowing an increased systolic pressure. If the left ventricle is\nunable properly to empty itself against the increased resistance\nahead, the left auricle will contain too much blood, and with the\nright ventricle sufficient, there will be an accentuation of the\nsecond pulmonic sound and it may become louder than the second\naortic sound, showing a cardiac deficiency. If, on the other hand,\nthe right ventricle becomes insufficient, or is insufficient, the\nsecond pulmonic sound is weaker than normal, and the prognosis is\nbad.\n\nBarach [Footnote: Barach: Am.

Barach does not believe we have, as yet, any\nvery accurate method of determining the cardiac strength or\ncirculatory capacity for work. He does not believe that the estimate\nof the pressure pulse is indicative of cardiac strength. He believes\nthat the important factors in the estimation of the circulatory\nstrength are the systolic pressure, which shows the power of the\nleft ventricle, the diastolic pressure, which shows the\nintravascular tension during diastole as well as the peripheral\nresistance, and the pulse rate, which designates the number of times\nthe heart must contract during a minute to maintain the proper flow\nof blood.

He thinks that these three factors are constantly adapting\nthemselves to each other for the needs of the individual, and he\nfinds, for instance, that when the left ventricle is hypertrophied\nand the output of blood is therefore greater, then the pulse will be\nslowed. His method of estimation is as follows: For instance, with a\nsystolic pressure of 120 mm. and a diastolic pressure of 80 mm.,\neach pulse beat will represent an energy equal to lifting 120 mm.\nplus 80 mm., which equals 200 mm. of mercury, and with seventy-two\npulse beats the force would be 72 X 200, which equals 14,400 mm. of\nmercury. He finds an average circulatory strength based on examining\n250 normal individuals by the index, which he terms S, D, R\n(systolic, diastolic rate), to be 20,000 mm. of mercury per minute.\n\nKatzenstein [Footnote: Katzenstein: Deutsch. med. Wehnsehr., April\n15, 1915.] finds, after ten years of experience, that the following\ntest of the heart strength is valuable: He records the blood\npressure and pulse, and then compresses the femoral artery at\nPoupart's ligament on the two sides at once. He keeps this pressure\nup for from two to two and one-half minutes, and then again takes\nthe blood pressure. With a sound heart the blood pressure will be\nhigher and the pulse slower than the previous record taken. If the\nblood pressure and pulse beat are not changed, it shows that the\nheart is not quite normal, but not actually incompetent. When the\nblood pressure is lower and the pulse accelerated, he believes that\nthere is distinct functional disturbance of the heart and loss of\npower, relatively to the change in pressure and the increase of the\npulse rate. He further believes that a heart showing this kind of\nweakness should, if possible, not be subjected to general\nanesthesia.\n\nStange [Footnote: Stange: Russk. Vrach, 1914, xiii. 72.] finds that\nthe cardiac power may be determined by a respiratory test as\nfollows: The patient should sit comfortably, and take a deep\ninspiration; then he should be told to hold his breath, and the\nphysician compresses the patient's nostrils. As soon as the patient\nindicates that he can hold his breath no longer, the number of\nseconds is noted. A normal person should hold his breath from thirty\nto forty seconds without much subsequent dyspnea, while a patient\nwith myocardial weakness can hold his breath only from ten to twenty\nseconds, and then much temporary dyspnea will follow. Stange does\nnot find that pulmonary conditions, as tuberculosis, pleurisy or\nbronchitis, interfere with this test.\n\nWilliamson [Footnote: Williamson: Ant. Jour. Med.

He thinks\nthat a heart which does not so respond by reducing its size after\nexercise has a damaged muscle, and compensation is more or less\nimpaired.\n\nPractical conclusions to draw from the foregoing suggestions are:\n\n1. An enlargement of the heart after exercise can be well shown only\nby fluoroscopic examination, and then best by some accurate method\nof measurement.\n\n2. The blood pressure should be immediately increased by exercise,\nand after such exercise should soon return to the normal before the\nexercise. If it goes below the normal the heart is weak, or the\nexercise was excessive.\n\n3. The pulse rate should increase with exercise, but not\nexcessively, and should within a reasonable time return to normal.\n\n4. The stethoscope will show whether or not the normal sounds of the\nheart become relatively abnormal after exercise. If such was the\nfact, though the abnormality was not permanent, heart insufficiency\nis more or less in evidence.\n\n5. The relation of pulse rate to blood pressure should always be\nnoted, and the working power of the heart may be estimated according\nto Barach's suggestion.\n\n6. The dumb-bell exercise tests suggested by Barringer (only, the\ndumb-bells may be of lighter weight) are valuable to note the\ngradual improvement in heart strength of patients under treatment.\n\n7. The holding the breath test is very suggestive of heart\nefficiency or weakness, but a series of tests must be made before\nits limitations are proved.\n\n\nTHE EFFECT OF ATHLETICS ON THE HEART\n\nWe can no longer neglect the seriousness of the effects of\ncompetitive athletics on the heart, especially in youth and young\nadults. Not only universities and preparatory schools, but also high\nschools and even grammar schools must consider the advisability of\ncontinuing competitive sports without more control than is now the\ncase. In the first place, the individual is likely to be trained in\none particular branch or in one particular line, which develops one\nparticular set of muscles. In the second place, competition to\nexhaustion, to vomiting, faintness, and even syncope is absolutely\ninexcusable. Furthermore, contests which partake of brutality should\ncertainly be seriously censored.\n\nA committee appointed some time ago by the Medical Society of the\nState of California [Footnote: California State Med. Jour., June,\n1916 p. 220.] has recently reported its endorsement of Foster's\n\"Indictment of Intercollegiate Athletics.\" After five years of\npersonal observation of no less than 100 universities and colleges,\nin thirty-eight states, Foster concludes that intercollegiate\nathletics have proved a failure, and that they are costly and\ninjurious on account of an excessive physical training of a few\nstudents, and of such students as need training least, while\nhealthful and moderate exercise at a small expense for all students\nis most needed.\n\nExperts, [Footnote: Rubner and Kraus: Vrtljsehr. f. gerichtl.

Exercise should\nbenefit all children and youth, while athletic prowess necessitates\ntaxing the organism to the limit of endurance, and hence is\ndangerous and should not be allowed in schools or universities.\n\nMcKenzie [Footnote: McKenzie: Am. Jour. Med. Sc., January, 1913, p.\n69.] found that exhausting tests of endurance were not adapted to\nthe development of children and youth, because the high blood\npressure caused by such exertion soon continued, and he found\nathletes to have a prolonged increased blood pressure. As is\nrecognized by all, boat racing is particularly bad, especially the\n4-mile row. Such severe exertion of course increases the blood\npressure, even in these athletes, and the heart increases its speed.\nThere is then exhilaration, later discomfort, and soon, as McKenzie\npoints out, a sensation of constriction in the chest and head. This\nis soon followed by breathlessness, and soon by a feeling of fulness\nin the head, and then syncope. The heart, of course, becomes\ndilated. Heart murmurs are often found after much less severe\nexertion than boat racing. They may not last long, or they may\ndisappear under proper treatment. He reported that after exercise\nthere were heart murmurs in seventy-four of 266 young men who were\nin normal health, and that nearly 28 per cent of all normal young\nmen will show a murmur after exercise. He thinks that it is rare to\nfind, after a week, a heart murmur in a previously healthy heart, if\nthe athlete has not passed the age of 30.\n\nThere can be no doubt that even one, to say nothing of more, such\nheart strains is inexcusable and may leave a more or less lasting\ninjury. Such heart strains and exertions are not entirely seen in\nathletes. A man otherwise well may cause such a heart strain by\ncranking his automobile, by pumping up a tire, by strenuous lifting,\nby carrying a load too far or too rapidly, or by running, and an\nelderly man may even cause such a heart strain by walking, hill\nclimbing, or even golfing, if he does these things. More or less\nacute dilatation occurring in such persons is likely to recur on the\nleast exertion, unless the patient takes a prolonged rest cure and\nthe heart is so well that it recuperates perfectly. Any chronic\nmyocarditis, however, may prevent such a heart from ever being as\nperfect as it was before.\n\nTorgersen, [Footnote: Torgersen: Norsk Mag. f.

Gymnasiums and athletic grounds in connection with all colleges,\npreparatory schools, seminaries and high schools are essential, and\nthey should be added to grammar schools whenever possible.\n\n2. Physical training and athletic games, and perhaps some type of\nmilitary training are valuable for the proper development of youth.\n\n3. Some forms of competitive games and some competitive feats are\nvaluable in stimulating training and healthful sports.\n\n4. All competitive sports and all hard training should be under the\nadvice and supervision of a medical council or a medical trainer.\nCompetitive sports which are generally recognized as harmful, mostly\non account of their duration as related to the age of the\ncompetitors, should be prohibited.\n\n5. Each boy should be carefully examined by a competent physician to\ndecide as to his general health, his limitations and the special\ntraining necessary to perfect him or to overcome any defect. Such\nexaminations are even more essential in schools for girls.\n\n6. In all group training, the weak individuals should be noted by\nthe medical trainer, and they should receive special and more\ncarefully graded exercise.\n\n7. In all strenuous training or competitive athletic work, the\nparticipators should all be examined more or less frequently and\nmore or less carefully for heart strain and albuminuria and also for\na too great increase of blood pressure.\n\n8. All training and all athletic sports should be graded to the age\nof the boy or girl and not necessarily to his or her size. Many an\novergrown boy is injured by athletic prowess beyond his heart\nstrength.\n\n\nSIGNS OF HEART WEAKNESS\n\nIt should be remembered that a normal heart may slow to about 60\nduring sleep, and all nervous acceleration of the pulse may be\ndifferentiated during sleep by the fact that if the heart does not\nmarkedly slow, there is cardiac weakness or some general\ndisturbance. There is also cardiac weakness if there is a tendency\nto yawn or to take long breaths after slight exertions or during\nexertion, or if there is a feeling of suffocation and the person\nsuddenly wants the windows open, or cannot work, even for a few\nminutes, in a closed room. If these disturbances are purely\nfunctional, exercise not only may be endured, but will relieve some\nnervous heart disturbances, while it will aggravate a real heart\ndisability. If the heart tends to increase in rapidity on lying\ndown, or the person cannot breathe well or feels suffocated with one\nordinary pillow, the heart shows more or less weakness.\nExtrasystoles are due to abnormal irritability of the heart muscle,\nand may or may not be noted by the patient.

It\nhas not been recognized until recently, as shown by Guthrie,\n[Footnote: Guthrie, J. B.: Cough Dilatation Time a Measure of Heart\nFunction, The Journal. A. M. A., Jan. 3, 1914, p. 30.] that even one\nattack of more or less hard coughing will temporarily enlarge the\nheart. From these slight occurrences, however, the heart quickly\nreturns to its normal size; but if the coughing is frequently\nrepeated, the dilatation is more prolonged. This emphasizes the\nnecessity of supporting the heart in serious pulmonary conditions,\nand also the necessity of modifying the intensity of the cough by\nnecessary drugs.\n\nIn deciding that a heart is enlarged by noting the apex beat,\npercussion dulness, and by fluoroscopy, it should be remembered that\nthe apex beat may be several centimeters to the left from the actual\nnormal point, and yet the heart not be enlarged.\n\nThe necessity of protecting the heart in acute infections, and the\nseriousness to the heart of infections are emphasized by the present\nknowledge that tonsillitis, acute or chronic, and mouth and nose\ninfections of all kinds can injure the heart muscle. In probably\nnearly every case of diphtheria, unless of the mildest type, there\nis some myocardial involvement, even if not more than 25 percent of\nsuch cases show clinical symptoms of such heart injury. Tuberculosis\nof different parts of the body also, sooner or later, injures the\nheart; and the effect of syphilis on the heart is now well\nrecognized.\n\n\nSYMPTOMS AND SIGNS OF CARDIAC DISTURBANCE\n\nIt is now recognized that any infection can cause weakness and\ndegeneration of the heart muscle. The Streptococcus rheumaticus\nfound in rheumatic joints is probably the cause of such heart injury\nin rheumatism. That prolonged fever from any cause injures heart\nmuscle has long been recognized, and cardiac dilatation after severe\nillness is now more carefully prevented. It is not sufficiently\nrecognized that chronic, slow-going infection can injure the heart.\nSuch infections most frequently occur in the tonsils, in the gums,\nand in the sinuses around the nose. Tonsillitis, acute or chronic,\nhas been shown to be a menace to the heart. Acute streptococcie\ntonsillitis is a very frequent disease, and the patient generally,\nunder proper treatment, quickly recovers. Tonsillitis in a more or\nless acute form, however, sometimes so mild as to be almost\nunnoticed, probably precedes most attacks of acute inflammatory\nrheumatism. Chronically diseased tonsils may not cause joint pains\nor acute fever, but they are certainly often the source of blood\ninfection and later of cardiac inflammations. The probability of\nchronic inflammation and weakening of the heart muscle from such\nslow-going and continuous infection must be recognized, and the\nsource of such infection", "doc_id": "8c75f50f-0153-4a09-8e88-801da2ec75ec", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "024b9b42ffd51d891284914aac179a2dc26389189f695bc6d73876aa7ba2d0bb", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 58868, "end": 62524}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "0238bef9-089f-4875-8e13-06ca1b2f551f", "3": "db54ca2a-74c1-485a-8ee6-16a3fcf04e30"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "db54ca2a-74c1-485a-8ee6-16a3fcf04e30": {"__data__": {"text": "in the sinuses around the nose.

Furthermore,\nthe heart is too readily eliminated from the cause of the general\ndisturbance because murmurs are not heard. A careful decision as to\nthe size of the heart will often show that it has become slightly\ndilated and is a cause of the general symptoms of weakness, leg\nweariness, slight dyspnea, epigastric distress or actual chest\npains. Many such cases are treated for gastric disturbance because\nthere are some gastric symptoms. There is no question that gastric\nflatulence, or hyperacidity, or a large meal causing distention of\nthe stomach may increase the cardiac disturbance, and the cardiac\ndisturbance may be laid entirely to indigestion; but treatment\ndirected toward the stomach, while it may ameliorate some of the\nsymptoms, will not remove the cause of the symptoms.\n\nIf the patient complains of pains in any part of the chest or upper\nabdomen, or of leg aches, or of being weary, or exhausted, or of\nsleeplessness at night, or of pains in the back of his head, we\nshould investigate the cardiac ability, besides ruling out all of\nthe more frequently recognized causes of these disturbances.\n\nIf there is more dyspnea than normally should occur in the\nindividual patient after walking rapidly or climbing a hill or going\nupstairs, or if after a period of a little excitement one finds that\nhe cannot breathe quite normally, or that something feels tight in\nhis chest, the heart needs resting. If, after one has been driving a\nmotor car or even sitting at rest in one which has been going at\nspeed or has come unpleasantly near to hitting something or to being\nrun into, it is noticed that the little period of cardiac\ndisturbance and chest tension is greater than it should be, the\nheart needs resting.\n\nIf the least excitement or exertion increases the cardiac speed\nabnormally, it means that for many minutes, if not actually hours\nduring the twenty-four, the heart is contracting too rapidly, and\nthis alone means muscle tire and muscle nutrition lost, even if\nthere is no actual defect in the cardiac muscle or in its own blood\nsupply. If we multiply these extra pulsations or contractions by the\nnumber of minutes a day that this extra amount of work is done, it\nwill easily be demonstrable to the physician and the patient what an\namount of good a rest, however partial, each twenty-four hours will\ndo to this heart.

Not infrequently disturbances\nof the aorta cause pain over the right side of the chest as well as\ntip into the neck. Real heart pains frequently occur without any\nvalvular lesion, and also when necropsies have shown that there has\nbeen no sclerosis of the coronary vessels.\n\nWhile angina pectoris is a distinct, well recognized condition,\npains in the regions mentioned, especially if they occur after\nexertion or after mental excitement or even after eating (provided a\nreal gastric excuse has been eliminated), are due to a disturbance\nof the heart, generally to an overstrained heart muscle or to a\nslight dilatation. Too much or too little blood in the cavity of the\nheart may cause distress and pain; or an imperfect circulation\nthrough the coronary arteries and the vessels of the heart,\nimpairing its nutrition or causing it to tire more readily, may be\nthe cause of these cardiac pains, distress or discomfort.\n\nPalpating the radial artery is not absolutely reliable in all cases\nof auricular fibrillation, or in another form of arrhythmia called\nauricular flutter or tachysystole. James and Hart [Footnote: James\nand Hart: Am. Jour. Med. Sc., 1914, cxlvii, 63.] have found that the\npulse is not a true criterion of the condition Of the circulation.\nThere is always a certain amount of heart block associated with\nauricular fibrillation so that not all of the auricular stimuli pass\nthrough the bundle of His. James and Hart determine the heart rate\nboth at the radial pulse and at the apex, the difference being\ncalled the pulse deficit. They use this deficit as an aid in\ndeciding when to stop the administration of digitalis. When the\npulse deficit is zero, the digitalis is stopped.

It\nis a specialization needed today almost more than in any other line\nof medical science.\n\nSo frequently is the cause of these pains, disturbances and weakness\noverlooked and the stomach or the intestines treated, or treatment\naimed at neuralgias, rheumatisms or rheumatic conditions, that a\ncareful examination of the patient, and a consideration of the part\nthe heart is playing in the causation of these symptoms are always\nnecessary.\n\nThe treatment required for such a heart, unless there is some\ncomplication, as a kidney complication or a too high blood pressure,\nor arteriosclerosis (and none of these causes necessarily prohibits\nenergetic cardiac treatment), is digitalis. If there is doubt as to\nthe condition of the cardiac arteries, digitalis should be given in\nsmall doses. If it causes distinct cardiac pain, it is not indicated\nand should be stopped. If, on the other hand, improvement occurs, as\nit generally does, the dose can be regulated by the results. The\nminimum dose which improves the condition is the proper one. Enough\nshould be given; too much should not be given. Before deciding that\ndigitalis does not improve the condition (provided it does not cause\ncardiac pain) the physician should know that a good and efficient\npreparation of digitalis is being taken. Strychnin will sometimes\nwhip up a tired heart and tide it over periods of depression, but it\nis a whip and not a cardiac tonic. While overeating, all\noverexertion, and alcohol should be stopped, and the amount of\ntobacco should be modified, there is no treatment so successful as\nmental and physical rest and a change of climate and scene, with\ngood clean air.\n\nMany persons with these symptoms of cardiac tire think that they are\nhouse-tired, shop-tired, or office-tired, and take on a physical\nexercise, such as walking, climbing, tennis playing or golf playing,\nto their injury. Such tired hearts are not ready yet for added\nphysical exercise; they should be rested first.\n\nThe treatment of this cardiac tire is not complete until the\ntonsils, gums, teeth and the nose and its accessory sinuses are in\ngood condition. Various other sources of chronic poisoning from\nchronic infection should of course be eliminated, whether an uncured\ngonorrhea, prostatitis, some chronic inflammation of the female\npelvic organs, or a chronic appendicitis.\n\nLongcope [Footnote: Longcope, W.

No condition can\nbe properly treated, no operation should be performed, and no\nprognosis is of value without a proper consideration of the\nsufficiency of the circulation, and the condition of the circulation\ncannot be properly estimated without an accurate estimate of the\nsystolic and diastolic blood pressure. However perfectly the heart\nmay act, it cannot properly circulate the blood without a normal\ntone of the blood vessels, both arteries and veins. Abnormal\nvasodilatation seriously interferes with the normal circulation, and\ncauses venous congestion, abnormal increase in venous blood\npressure, and the consequent danger of shock and death. Increased\narterial tone or tonicity necessitates greater cardiac effort, to\novercome the resistance, and hypertrophy of the heart must follow.\nThis hypertrophy always occurs if the peripheral resistance is not\nsuddenly too great or too rapidly acquired. In other words, if the\nperipheral resistance gradually increases, the left ventricle\nhypertrophies, and remains for a long time sufficient. If, from\ndisease or disturbance in the lungs, the resistance in the pulmonary\ncirculation is increased, the right ventricle hypertrophies to\novercome it, and the circulation is sufficient as long as this\nventricle is able to do the work. If either this pulmonary increased\npressure or the systemic increased pressure persists or becomes too\ngreat, it is only a question of how many months, in the case of the\nright ventricle, and how many years, in the case of the left\nventricle, the heart can stand the strain.\n\nIf the cause of the increased systemic tension is an arterial\nfibrosis, sooner or later the heart will become involved in this\ngeneral condition, and a chronic myocarditis is likely to result.\nIf, on the other hand, there", "doc_id": "c63339a9-a688-4629-8180-88df4e8db187", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d76c64dd2b7b069d85cba5bf54a1b48c3fdb75419f344221e908b937e6d4c1d9", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 74088, "end": 77636}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "d125963b-32e6-42ec-b378-a896e11531ce", "3": "1b6fff98-baad-4309-94ee-d41d91dab080"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b6fff98-baad-4309-94ee-d41d91dab080": {"__data__": {"text": "sufficient.

It is evident, therefore, that an\nabnormally high blood pressure is of serious import, its cause must\nbe studied, and effort must be made to remove as far as possible the\ncause. On the other hand, a persistently low blood pressure may be\nof serious import, and always diminishes physical ability. If\npossible, the cause should be determined, and the condition\nimproved.\n\nNo physician can now properly practice medicine without having a\nreliable apparatus for determining the blood pressure both in his\noffice and at the bedside. It is not necessary to discuss here the\nvarious kinds of apparatus or what is essential in an apparatus for\nit to give a perfect reading. It may be stated that in determining\nthe systolic and diastolic pressure in the peripheral arteries, the\nordinary stethoscope is as efficient as any more elaborate\nauscultatory apparatus.\n\nIt is now generally agreed by all scientific clinicians that it is\nas essential--almost more essential--to determine the diastolic\npressure as the systolic pressure; therefore the auscultatory method\nis the simplest, as well as one of the most accurate in determining\nthese pressures. Of course it should be recognized that the systolic\npressure thus obtained will generally be some millimeters above that\nobtained with the finger, perhaps the average being equivalent to\nabout 5 mm. of mercury. The diastolic pressure will often range from\n10 to 15 mm. below the reading obtained by other methods. Therefore,\nwider range of pressure is obtained by the auscultatory method than\nby other methods. This difference of 5 or more millimeters of\nsystolic pressure between the auscultatory and the palpatory\nreadings should be remembered when one is consulting books or\narticles printed more than two years ago, as many of these pressures\nwere determined by the palpatory method.\n\nSometimes the compression of the arm by the armlet leads to a rise\nin blood pressure. [Footnote: MacWilliams and Melvin: Brit. Med.\nJour., Nov. 7, 1914.] It has been suggested that the diastolic\npressure be taken at the point where the sound is first heard on\ngradually raising the pressure in the armlet.\n\nIn some persons the auscultatory readings cannot be made, or are\nvery unsatisfactory, and it becomes necessary to use the palpation\nmethod in taking the systolic pressure. In instances in which the\nauscultatory method is unsatisfactory, the artery below the bend of\nthe elbow at which the reading is generally taken may be misplaced,\nor there may be an unusual amount of fat and muscle between the\nartery and the skin.\n\nThe various sounds heard with the stethoscope, when the pressure is\ngradually lowered, have been divided into phases. The first phase\nbegins with the first audible sound, which is the proper point at\nwhich to read the, systolic pressure. The first phase is generally,\nnot always, succeeded by a second phase in which there is a\nmurmurish sound. The third phase is that at which the maximum sharp,\nringing note begins, and throughout this phase the sound is sharp\nand intense,", "doc_id": "1b6fff98-baad-4309-94ee-d41d91dab080", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0ad6a4211110d90c62879ffc47c4b930b3aa8d0688f6a7d9d1b3a1548dc71886", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 77611, "end": 81586}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "c63339a9-a688-4629-8180-88df4e8db187", "3": "d35ab503-1de4-4cf6-a6d7-5b3bbcbe4923"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d35ab503-1de4-4cf6-a6d7-5b3bbcbe4923": {"__data__": {"text": "in taking the systolic pressure.

The third phase is that at which the maximum sharp,\nringing note begins, and throughout this phase the sound is sharp\nand intense, gradually increasing, and then gradually diminishing to\nthe fourth phase, where the sound suddenly becomes a duller tone.\nThe fourth phase lasts until what is termed the fifth phase, or that\nat which all sound has disappeared. As previously stated, the\ndiastolic pressure may be read at the beginning of the fourth phase,\nor at the end of the fourth phase, that is, the beginning of the\nfifth; but the difference is from 3 to 10 mm. of mercury, with an\naverage of perhaps 5 mm.; therefore the difference is not very\ngreat. When the diastolic pressure is high, for relative subsequent\nreadings, it is much better to read the diastolic at the beginning\nof the fifth phase.\n\nIt is urged by many observers that the proper reading of the\ndiastolic pressure is always at the beginning of the fourth phase.\nHowever, for general use, unless one is particularly expert, it is\nbetter to read the diastolic pressure at the beginning of the fifth\nphase. There can rarely be a doubt in the mind of the person who is\nauscultating as to the point at which all sound ceases. There is\nfrequently a good deal of doubt, even after large experience, as to\njust the moment at which the fourth phase begins. With the\nunderstanding that the difference is only a few millimeters, which\nis of very little importance, when the diastolic pressure is below\n95, it seems advisable to urge the reading of the diastolic pressure\nat the beginning of the fifth phase.\n\nThe incident of the first phase, or when sound begins, is caused by\nthe sudden distention of the blood vessel below the point of\ncompression by the armlet. In other words, the armlet pressure has\nat this point been overcome. Young [Footnote: Young: Indiana State\nMed. Assn. Jour., March, 1914.] believes that the murmurs of the\nsecond phase, which in all normal conditions are heard during the 20\nmm. drop below the point at which the systolic pressure had been\nread, is \"due to whirlpool eddies produced at the point of\nconstriction of the blood vessel by the cuff of the instrument.\" The\nthird phase is when these murmurs cease and the sound resembles the\nfirst, lasting he thinks for only 5 mm. The third phase often lasts\nmuch longer. He thinks the fourth phase, when the sound becomes\ndull, lasts for about 6 mm.\n\n\nTECHNIC\n\nIt is essential that the patient on whom the examination is to be\nmade should be at rest, either comfortably seated, or lying down.\nAll clothing should be removed from the arm, and there should be no\nconstriction by sleeves, either of the upper arm or the axilla. When\nthe blood pressure is taken over the sleeve of a garment, the\ninstrument will register from 10 to 30 mm. higher than on the bare\narm. [Footnote: Rowan, J.

The right arm of right handed persons usually registers a\nfull 5 mm. higher systolic pressure than the left arm.\n\nThe patient, being at rest and removed as far as possible from all\nexcitement, may be conversed with to take his mind away from the\nfact that his blood pressure is being taken. He also should not\nwatch the dial, as any tensity on his part more or less raises the\nsystolic pressure, the diastolic not being much affected by such\nnervous tension. The armlet having been carefully applied, it is\nbetter to inflate gradually 10 mm. higher than the point at which\nthe pulsation ceases in the radial. The stethoscope is then firmly\napplied, but with not too great pressure, to the forearm just below\nthe flexure of the elbow. The exact point at which the sound is\nheard in the individual patient, and the exact amount of pressure\nthat must be applied, will be determined by the first reading, and\nthen thus applied to the second reading. One reading is never\nsufficient for obtaining the correct blood pressure. The blood\npressure may be read by means of the stethoscope during the gradual\nraising of pressure in the cuff, note being taken of the first sound\nthat is heard (the diastolic pressure), and the point at which all\nsound disappears, as the pressure is increased (the systolic\npressure). The former method is the one most frequently used.\n\nBy taking the systolic and diastolic pressures, the difference\nbetween the two being the pressure pulse, we learn to interpret the\npressure pulse reading. While the average pressure pulse has\nfrequently been stated as 30 mm., it is probable that 35 at least,\nand often 40 mm. represents more nearly the normal pressure pulse,\nand from 25 mm. on the one hand to 50 on the other may not be\nabnormal.\n\nFaught [Footnote: Faught: New York Med Jour., Feb. 27, 1915, p.\n396.] states his belief that the relation of the pressure pulse to\nthe diastolic pressure and the systolic pressure are as 1, 2 and 3.\nIn other words, a normal young adult with a systolic pressure of 120\nshould have a diastolic pressure of 80, and therefore a pulse\npressure of 40. If these relationships become much abnormal, disease\nis developing and imperfect circulation is in evidence, with the\ndanger of broken compensation occurring at some time in the future.\n\nIt should be remembered that the diastolic pressure represents the\npressure which the left ventricle must overcome before the blood\nwill begin to circulate, that is, before the aortic valve opens,\nwhile the pressure pulse represents the power of the left ventricle\nin excess of the diastolic pressure. Therefore it is easy to\nunderstand that a high diastolic pressure is of serious import to\nthe heart; a diastolic pressure over 100 is significant of trouble,\nand over 110 is a menace.\n\n\nFACTORS INCREASING THE BLOOD PRESSURE\n\nWith normal heart and arteries, exertion and exercise should\nincrease the systolic pressure, and generally somewhat increase the\ndiastolic pressure. The pressure pulse should therefore be greater.\nWhen there is circulatory defect or abnormal blood pressure,\nexercise may not increase the systolic pressure, and the pressure\npulse may grow smaller.

As a working rule it should be noted that\nthe diastolic pressure is not as much influenced by physiologic\nfactors or the varying conditions of normal life as is the systolic\npressure.\n\nIn an irregularly acting heart the systolic pressure may vary\ngreatly, from 10 to 20 mm. or more, and a ventricular contraction\nmay not be of sufficient power to open the semilunar valves. Such\nbeats will show an intermittency in the blood pressure reading as\nwell as in the radial pulse. The succeeding heart beats after\nabortive beats or after a contraction of less power have increased\nforce, and consequently give the highest blood pressure. Kilgore\nurges that these highest pressures should not be taken as the true\nsystolic blood pressure, but the average of a series of these\nvarying blood pressures. In irregularly acting hearts it is best to\ncompress the arm at a point above which the systolic pressure is\nheard, then gradually reduce the pressure until the first systolic\npressure is recorded, and then keep the pressure of the cuff at this\npoint and record the number of beats of the heart which are heard\nduring the minute. Then reduce the pressure 5 mm. and read again for\na minute, and so on down the scale until the varying systolic\npressures are recorded. The average of these pressures should be\nread as the true systolic blood pressure. During an intermittency of\nthe pulse from a weak or intermittently acting ventricle, the\ndiastolic pressure will reach its lowest point, and in auricular\nfibrillation the pressure pulse from the highest systolic to the\nlowest diastolic may be very great.\n\nIn arteriosclerosis the systolic may be high, and the diastolic low,\nand hence a large pressure pulse. When the heart begins to fail in\nthis condition, the systolic pressure drops and the pressure pulse\nshortens, and of course any improvement in this condition will be\nshown by an increase in the systolic pressure. The same is true with\naortic regurgitation and a high systolic pressure.\n\nIf the systolic pressure is low and the diastolic very low, or when\nthe heart is rapid, circulation through the coronary vessels of the\nheart is more or less imperfect. Any increase in arterial pressure\nwill therefore help the coronary circulation. The compression of a\ntight bandage around the abdomen, or the infusion of blood or saline\nsolutions, especially when combined with minute amounts of\nepinephrin, will raise the blood pressure and increase the coronary\ncirculation and therefore the nutrition of the heart.\n\nMacKenzie [Footnote: MacKenzie: Med Rec., New York, Dec. 18, 1915.],\nfrom a large number of insurance examinations in normal subjects,\nfinds that for each increase of 5 pulse beats the pressure rises 1\nmm.

On the other hand, it is now\ngenerally proved that persons with overweight have a systolic\npressure greater than is normal for individuals of the same age.

While the systolic range from youth to over 60\nyears of age gradually increases, at the younger age anything below\n105 mm. of mercury should be considered abnormally low, and although\n150 mm. at anything over 40 has been considered a safe blood\npressure as long as the diastolic was below 105, such pressures are\ncertainly a subject for investigation, and if the systolic pressure\nis persistently above 150, insurance companies dislike to take the\nrisk. However, it should be again urged in making insurance\nexaminations that psychic disturbance or mental tensity very readily\nraises the systolic pressure. MacKenzie believes that a diastolic\npressure over 100 under the age of 40 is abnormal, and anything over\nthe 110 mark above that age is certainly abnormal.\n\nIt has been shown, notably by Barach and Marks, [Footnote: Barach,\nJ. H., and Marks, W. L.: Effect of Change of Posture--Without Active\nMuscular Exertion--on the Arterial and Venous Pressures, Arch. Int.\nMed., May, 1913, p 485.] that posture changes the blood pressure.\nWhen a normal person reclines, with the muscular system relaxed,\nthere is an increase in the systolic pressure and a decrease in the\ndiastolic pressure, with an increase in the pressure pulse from the\nfigures found when the person is standing. When, after some minutes\nof repose, he assumes the erect posture again, the systolic pressure\nwill diminish and the diastolic pressure increase, and the pressure\npulse shortens.\n\nExcitement can raise the blood pressure from 20 to 30 mm., and if\nsuch excitement occurs in high tension cases there is often a\nsystolic blow in the second intercostal space at the right of the\nsternum. This may not be due to narrowing of the aortic orifice; it\nmay be due to a sclerosis of the aorta. On the other hand, it may be\ndue entirely to the hastened blood stream from the nervous\nexcitability. This is probably the case if this sound disappears\nwhen the patient reclines. If it increases when the heart becomes\nslower and the patient is lying down, the cause is probably organic.\n\nThis psychic influence on blood pressure is stated by Maloney and\nSorapure [Footnote: Maloney and Sorapure: New York Med. Jour., May\n23, 1914, p. 1021.] \"to be greater than that from posture, than that\narising from carbonic acid gas control of the blood, than that\narising from mechanical action of deep breathing upon the\ncirculation, and than that arising from removal of spasm from the\nmusculature.\"\n\nWeysse and Lutz [Footnote: Weysse and Lutz: Am.

Fear always increases the blood\npressure. This is probably largely due to the peripheral\ncontractions of the blood vessels and nervous chilling of the body.\n\n\nVENOUS PRESSURE\n\nThe venous pressure, after a long neglect, is now again being\nstudied, and its determination is urged as of diagnostic and\nprognostic significance.\n\nHooker [Footnote: Hooker: Am. Jour. Physiol., March, 1916.] says\nthere is a progressive rise of venous pressure from youth to old\nage. He has described an apparatus [Footnote: Hooker: Am. Jour.\nPhysiol., 1914, xxxv, 73.] which allows of the reading of the blood\npressure in a vein of the hand when the arm is at absolute rest, and\nbest with the patient in bed and reclining at an angle of 45\ndegrees. He finds that just before death there is a rapid rise in\nvenous pressure, or a continuously high pressure above the 20 cm. of\nwater level, and he believes that a venous pressure continuously\nabove this 20 cm. of water limit which is not lowered by digitalis\nor other means is serious; and that the heart cannot long stand such\na condition. These dangerous rises in venous pressure are generally\ncoincident with a fall of systolic arterial pressure, although there\nmay be no constant relation between the two. He also finds that with\nan increase of venous pressure the urinary output decreases. This,\nof course, shows venous stasis in the kidneys as well as a probable\nlowering of arterial pressure.\n\nClark [Footnote: Clark, A. D.: A Study of the Diagnostic and\nPrognostic Significance of Venous Pressure Observations in Cardiac\nDisease, Arch. Int. Med., October, 1915, p. 587.] did not find that\nvenesection prevented a subsequent rapid rise in venous pressure in\ndire cases. From his investigations he concludes that a venous\npressure of 20 cm. of water is a danger limit between compensation\nand decompensation of the heart, and a rise above this point will\nprecede the clinical signs of decompensation.\n\nHooker also found that there are daily variations of venous pressure\nfrom 10 to 20 cm. of water, with an average of 15 cm., while in\nsleep it falls 7 or 8 cm.\n\nIt seems probable that there may be a special nervous mechanism of\nthe veins which may increase the blood pressure in them as\nepinephrin solution may cause some constriction.\n\nWiggers [Footnote: Wiggers C.

A.M.A., April 24, 1915, p. 1380.] carefully describes\nthe readings and the different phases of normal arterial pulse, and\nurges that it should be remembered that \"the pulse as palpated or\nrecorded from any artery is the variation in the arterial volume\nproduced by the intra-arterial pressure change at that point.\"\n\nA quick method of estimating the venous pressure by lowering and\nraising the arm has long been utilized. The dilatation of the veins\nof the back of the hand when the hand is raised should disappear,\nand they should practically collapse, in normal conditions, when the\nhand is at the level of the apex of the heart. When the venous\npressure is increased, this collapse will not occur until the hand\nis above the level of the heart. Oliver [Footnote: Oliver: Quart.\nMed Jour., 1907, i, 59.] found that the venous pressure denoted by\nthe collapse of the veins may be shown approximately in millimeters\nof mercury by multiplying by 2 each inch above the level of the\nheart in which the veins collapse. When a normal person reclines\nafter standing there is a fall in venous pressure, and when he again\nstands erect there is an increase in venous pressure.\n\nBailey [Footnote: Bailey: Am. Jour Med. Sc., May, 1911, p. 709.]\nstates that in interpreting pulsation in the peripheral veins, it\nshould not be forgotten that they may overlie pulsating arteries.\nPulsation in veins may be due also to an aneurysmal dilatation, or\nto direct connection with an artery. As the etiology in many\ninstances of varicose veins is uncertain, he thinks that they may be\ncaused by incompetence of the right heart, more or less temporary\nperhaps, from muscular exertion. This incompetence being frequently\nrepeated, peripheral veins may dilate. Moreover, the contraction of\nthe right heart may cause a wave in the veins of the extremities,\nand he believes that incompetency of the tricuspid valve may be the\ncause of varicosities in the veins of the extremities.\n\n\nNORMAL BLOOD PRESSURE FOR ADULTS\n\nWoley [Footnote: Woley, II.

Jour. Med. Sc., April, 1914, p.\n514.] believes that with a low systolic pressure and a large\npressure pulse there is probably a strong heart and dilated blood\nvessels, while with a low systolic pressure and a small pressure\npulse the heart itself is weak, with also, perhaps, dilated blood\nvessels. If there is a high systolic pressure and a correspondingly\nhigh diastolic pressure, the balance between the vessels and the\nheart is compensated as long as the heart muscle is sufficient. He\nbelieves the velocity of the blood in the blood stream may be\nroughly estimated as being equal to the pressure pulse multiplied by\nthe pulse rate.\n\nFaber 44 [Footnote: Faber: Ugeskrifta f.

Jour. Dis. Child., April, 1911, p. 272.] after\na study of the blood pressure in 350 children, came to the\nconclusion that the blood pressure in children increases with age\nprincipally because of the increase in height and weight, as she\nfound that children of the same age but of different weights and\nheights had different blood pressures. Sex in children makes no\ndifference in the blood pressure, it being determined by the height\nand weight.\n\nJudson and Nicholson [Footnote: Judson, C. F., and Nicholson,\nPercival: Blood Pressure in Normal Children, Am. Jour. Dis. Child.,\nOctober, 1914, p. 257.] made 2,300 observations in children of from\n3 to 15 years of age, and found there was a gradual increase in the\nsystolic blood pressure from 3 to 10 years, and a more rapid rise\nfrom 10 to 14, with a rapid elevation during the fourteenth year, or\nthe age of puberty. The systolic pressure varied from 91 mm. in the\nfourth year to 105.5 in the fourteenth year, while the diastolic\npressure remained almost at a uniform level.

[Footnote: Quackenbos: New York Med. Jour., May 15,\n1915, p. 999.] Some companies have ruled that at the age of 20 they\nwill take a person with a systolic pressure up to 137; at the age of\n30 up to 140; at the age of 40 up to 144; at 50 up to 148, and at 60\nup to 153, although some companies will not accept a person who\nshows a persistent systolic pressure of 150. Quackenbos says that\nwhen persons with higher blood pressures than the foregoing have\nbeen kept under observation for some time, they sooner or later show\nalbumin and casts in the urine. In other words, this stage of higher\nblood pressure is too frequently followed by cardiovascular-renal\ndisease for insurance companies to accept the risk.\n\nOn the other hand, too low a systolic pressure in an adult, 105 mm.\nor below, should cause suspicion of some serious condition, the most\nfrequent being a latent or quiescent tuberculosis. Such low pressure\ncertainly shows decreased power of resistance to any acute disease.\n\nStatistics prove that there are more deaths between the ages of 40\nand 50 from cardiovascular-renal disease, that is from heart,\narterial and kidney degenerations, than formerly. Whether this is\ndue to the high tension at which we all live, or to the fact that\nmore children are saved and live to middle life, or whether the\nprevention of many infectious diseases saves deficient individuals\nfor this middle life period, has not been determined. Probably all\nare factors in bringing about these statistics.\n\nWhile the continued use of alcohol may not cause arteriosclerosis\ndirectly, it can cause such impaired digestion of foods in the\nstomach and intestine, and such impaired activity of the glands,\nespecially the liver, that toxins from imperfect digestion and from\nwaste products are more readily produced and absorbed, and these are\nbelieved by some directly or indirectly to cause cardiovascular-\nrenal disease. Hence alcohol is an important factor in causing the\ndeath of persons from 40 to 50 years of age.\n\nThe question of whether or not a person smokes too much, and what\nconstitutes oversmoking, will soon be asked on all insurance blanks.\nAs tobacco almost invariably raises the blood pressure, and when the\nblood pressure again falls there is again a craving in the man for\nthe narcotic, it must be a factor in producing, later in life,\ncardiovascular-renal disease. Hence an increased systolic blood\npressure must be in part interpreted by the amount of tobacco that\nthe person uses. BLOOD PRESSURE AND PREGNANCY Evans [Footnote:\nEvans: Month. Cyc. and Med.

S.: The Blood Pressure During\nPregnancy, THE JOURNAL A. M. A., Jan. 30, 1915, p. 393.] has studied\nthe blood pressure during normal pregnancy, and finds that when the\nsystolic pressure is persistently below 100, the patient is far\nbelow par, and that the condition should be improved in order for\nher to withstand the strain of parturition. When the systolic\npressure is above 130, the patient should be carefully watched, and\nhe thinks that 150 is the danger line. Some pregnant women have an\nincreasing rise in blood pressure throughout the pregnancy, without\nalbuminuria. In other cases this rise is followed by the appearance\nof albumin in the urine. Thirty-nine of the patients studied by\nNewell had albumin in the urine without increase in blood pressure;\nhence he believes that a slight amount of albumin may not be\naccompanied by other symptoms. Five patients had a blood pressure of\n140 or over throughout their pregnancy, and in only one of these\npatients was albumin found. All passed through labor normally,\nshowing that a blood pressure below 150 may not necessarily be\nindicative of a serious condition; but a patient who has a systolic\npressure over 135 must certainly be carefully watched. A fact\nbrought out by Newell's investigations is very important, namely,\nthat a continuously increased blood pressure is not as indicative of\ntrouble as when a blood pressure has been low and later suddenly\nrises.\n\nHirst [Footnote: Hirst: Pennsylvania Med. Jour., May, 1915, p. 615.]\nalso urges that a high blood pressure in pregnancy does not\nnecessarily represent a toxemia, and also that a serious toxemia can\noccur with a blood pressure of 130 or lower, although such instances\nare rare. Hirst believes that when a toxemia is in evidence in\npregnancy while the blood pressure is low, the cause of the toxemia\nis liver disturbance rather than kidney disturbance, and he thinks\nthis form of toxemia is more serious and has a higher mortality than\nthe nephritic type. Therefore in a patient with eclamptic symptoms\nand a low blood pressure, the prognosis is more unfavorable than\nwhen the blood pressure is high. He believes that if high blood\npressure occurs early in the months of pregnancy, there is\npreexisting, although perhaps latent, nephritis. In these conditions\nthe diastolic pressure is also likely to be high.\n\nWith the patient eclamptic and stupid, whatever the date of the\npregnancy, Hirst would do venesection immediately in amount from 16\nto 24 ounces, depending on what amount seems advisable. If\nvenesection is done before actual convulsions have occurred, the\nblood pressure falls temporarily but rapidly rises again. He finds\nthat if a patient is past the eighth month, rupture of the membranes\nwill usually bring a rapid fall of from 50 to 90 points in systolic\npressure. Usually, of course, such rupture of the membranes will\ninduce labor. He finds that the fluidextract of veratrum viride is\nvaluable when eclampsia is in evidence or imminent.

He does not speak\nof treatment by thyroid extracts, which has been regarded as\nvaluable by some other workers.\n\nIn these patients who show eclamptic symptoms, he maintains a milk\ndiet, and purging and sweating. It should be remembered that\nvenesection or profuse bleeding during induced parturition is more\nvaluable than sweating in all eclamptic cases and in all nephritic\nconvulsions. Profuse sweating does little more than take the water\nout of the blood, and even concentrates the poisons in the blood.\n\nHirst causes purging by 2 ounces of castor oil and a few minims of\ncroton oil. He also advises large doses of magnesium sulphate. In\nsuch serious disturbances as eclampsia, it is not necessary to give\na magnesium salt, which, it has been shown, can have unpleasant\naction on the nervous system. Sodium sulphate is as valuable and is\nnot open to this danger.\n\nHirst urges that whatever the blood pressure, with albuminuria, as\nsoon as persistent headache occurs, and especially if there are\ndisturbances of vision, the pregnancy must be terminated at once. On\nthis there can be no other opinion. Temporizing with such a case is\ninexcusable.\n\nAfter labor has been induced there is an immediate fall of blood\npressure, which lasts some hours. The pressure will again rise, and\nusually is the last sign of toxemia to disappear, and he finds that\nthis increased pressure may last from two to three weeks when there\nis not much nephritis, and several months when there is nephritis.\n\nAlthough he says he has found no bad action from ergot, either by\nthe mouth or hypodermically in these eclamptic cases, it would seem\ninadvisable to use ergot, which may raise the blood pressure.

Burker [Footnote: Burker,\nK.; Jooss, E.; Moll, E., and Neumann, E.: Ztschr. f. Biol., 1913,\nlxi, 379. The Influence of Altitude on the Blood, editorial, THE\nJOURNAL A. M. A., Nov. 1, 1913, p. 1634.] showed that altitude\nincreases the red blood cells from 4 to 11.5 percent, and the\nhemoglobin from 7 to 10 percent The greatest increase in these\nreadings is in the first few days. It has also been shown that with\nevery 100 mm. of fall of atmospheric pressure there is an increased\nhemoglobin percentage of 10 percent over that at the sea level.\n[Footnote: Blood and Respiration at Moderate Altitudes, editorial,\nTHE JOURNAL A. M. A., Feb. 20, 1915, p. 670.]\n\nSchneider and Havens [Footnote: Schneider and Havens: Am. Jour.\nPhysiol., March, 1915.] find that in low altitudes abdominal massage\nincreases the red corpuscles, and the percentage of hemoglobin in\nthe peripheral vessels. While there is thus apparently a reserve of\nred corpuscles while the individual is in a low altitude, in a high\naltitude they find such reserve to be absent; in other words,\nabdominal massage did not cause this increase in red corpuscles in\nthe peripheral vessels. This absence of reserve is easily accounted\nfor by the fact that after one reaches the high altitude there is an\nincrease in red corpuscles and hemoblogin in the peripheral blood.\n\nSchneider and Hedblom [Footnote: Schneider and Hedblom: Am. Jour.,\nPhysiol., November, 1908.] showed that the fall in systolic pressure\nat altitudes is greater and more certain than the fall in diastolic,\nsome individuals even having a rise in diastolic pressure. This rise\nin diastolic pressure is probably caused by dyspnea.\n\nSchrumpf, [Footnote: Schrumpf: Deutsch. Arch. f. klin. Med., 1914,\ncxiii, 466] on the other hand, finds that normal blood pressure is\nnot much affected by an ascent of about 6,500 feet, while patients\nwith arteriosclerosis and hypertension, without kidney disease, have\na fall in pressure. A patient with coronary disease should certainly\nnot go to any great altitude, while patients with compensated\nvalvular lesions, he found, were not injured by ordinary heights. He\nfound that altitude seemed to decrease high systolic and diastolic\npressures, while it even elevated those which were below normal, and\ncaused these patients to feel better.\n\nAny person who has a circulatory disturbance, and who must or does\ngo to a higher altitude, should rest for a series of days, until his\nblood pressure", "doc_id": "6b6a6d06-bd87-4dfe-a109-db88e620394d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fb7c9b2f5b9cca188429f0fa476ebd17c55075ffa042e6e3bdd378582527d173", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 119227, "end": 122806}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "9da33727-6cdc-424b-80e4-1af28765623e", "3": "191f2e80-7cfb-40e5-be27-7a7e1a0aeb42"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "191f2e80-7cfb-40e5-be27-7a7e1a0aeb42": {"__data__": {"text": "Med., 1914,\ncxiii, 466] on the other hand, finds that normal blood pressure is\nnot much affected by an ascent of about 6,500 feet, while patients\nwith arteriosclerosis and hypertension, without kidney disease, have\na fall in pressure.

C.: The Effect of Altitude on Blood\nPressure, THE JOURNAL A. M. A., May 29, 1915, p. 1812.] made a\nseries of observations on blood pressures at Fort Stanton which has\nan altitude of 6,230 feet. He took the blood pressure readings in\nfifty-four young adults, seventeen of whom were women, and found\nthat the average systolic reading in the men was 129 mm., and in the\nwomen 121, while the average diastolic in the men was 84, and in the\nwomen 82. Therefore he agrees with Schrumpf that the effect of\naltitude on normal blood pressure has been overestimated. In\ntuberculosis he found that the effect of altitude was not great. He\ndoes not believe that this amount of altitude, namely, a little more\nthan 6,000 feet, makes much difference in an ordinary tuberculous\npatient. He did not find that artificial pneumothorax made any\nimportant change in the blood pressure. His findings do not quite\nagree with Peters and Bullock, [Footnote: Peters, L. S.r and\nBullock, E. S.: Blood Pressure Studies in Tuberculosis at a High\nAltitude, Arch. Int. Med., October, 1913, p. 456.] who studied 600\ncases of tuberculosis at an altitude of 6,000 feet, and found the\nblood pressure was increased, both in normal and in consumptive\nindividuals. They also found that the increase in blood pressure,\nwhich kept gradually rising up to a certain limit, was indicative\nthat the tuberculous patient was not much toxic; therefore the\nincrease in blood pressure was of good prognosis.\n\n\nCONDITIONS CAUSING CHANGE IN BLOOD PRESSURE\n\nWoolley [Footnote: Woolley, P. G.: Factors Governing Vascular\nDilatation and Slowing of the Blood Stream in Inflammation, THE\nJOURNAL A. M. A., Dec. 26, 1914, p. 2279.] quotes Starling as\nfinding that the blood vessels dilate from physical and chemical\nchanges in the musculature, and that this dilatation is caused by\ndeficient oxidation and accumulation of the products of metabolism,\nincluding carbon dioxid. This dilatation ordinarily is transient and\nnot associated with exudation, but in inflammation the dilatation is\npersistent and there is exudation. The carbon dioxid increase during\nexercise stimulates a greater circulation of oxygen in the tissues\nwhich later counteracts the normal increase in acid products. In\ninflammatory processes, however, the acid accumulates too rapidly to\nallow of saturation. In this case the circulation becomes slowed and\nthe cells become affected.\n\nBesides these charges in the blood vessels of the muscles, the\ngeneral blood pressure becomes raised on exercise, the heart more\nrapid and the temperature somewhat elevated, and the breathing is\nincreased. This increased heart rate does not stop immediately on\ncessation of the exercise, but persists for a longer or shorter\ntime. The better trained the individual, the sooner the speed of the\nheart becomes normal.\n\nBenedict and Cathcart [Footnote: Benedict and Cathcart: Pub. 77,\nCarnegie Institute of Washington.] have found that the increased\nabsorption of", "doc_id": "191f2e80-7cfb-40e5-be27-7a7e1a0aeb42", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a80f627a90f9f311d606c276901de1bcfd4d3e4680c70e3654cb20a254628b79", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 122793, "end": 126560}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "6b6a6d06-bd87-4dfe-a109-db88e620394d", "3": "0fbb9467-2652-4df1-bbdf-6e4105c261d4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fbb9467-2652-4df1-bbdf-6e4105c261d4": {"__data__": {"text": "later counteracts the normal increase in acid products.

Med., February,\n1914, p. 287.] have found that increased temperature in animals,\nequal to that occurring in persons suffering with infection, reduces\nthe blood pressure, causing a hypotension. This shows that high\ntemperature alone in an individual sooner or later causes\nhypotension.\n\nAlthough prolonged pain may cause a fall of blood pressure from\nshock, the first acute pain may cause a rise in blood pressure, and\nCurschmann [Footnote: Curschmann: Munchen. med. Wehnschr., Oct. 15,\n1907.] found that the blood pressure was high in the gastro-\nintestinal crises of tabes and in colic, and that the application of\nfaradic electricity to the thigh could raise the blood pressure from\n8 to 10 mm. in normal individuals.\n\nThe positive effect of decomposition products in the intestine, more\nespecially such as come from meat proteins, is well recognized; but\nthe importance, in high pressure cases, of the absorption of toxins\nderived from imperfectly digested food remaining in the bowels over\nnight is not sufficiently recognized. Patients with high blood\npressure should not eat a heavy evening meal, and especially should\nthey not eat meat. Willson [Footnote: Willson, R. N.: The\nDecomposition Food Products as Cardiovascular Products, THE JOURNAL\nA. M. A., Sept. 25, 1915, p. 1077.] well describes the condition\ncaused by the absorption of these toxins. If the heart muscle is\nintact, he finds such absorption in high pressure cases will show\ndiastolic as well as systolic increase:\n\n The vessels pulsate and throb; the skin is pale; the head aches;\nthe tongue is coated; the breath is foul; vertigo is often\ndistressing; and not infrequently the hands and feet feel distended\nand swollen.

He found that in seriously ill patients this high diastolic\npressure is of bad prognosis. He also found that a lower systolic\npressure with a lower diastolic pressure is not a sign that the\nheart is weakening, but only that the visceral tone is growing less.\nOn the other hand, when the diastolic pressure rises while the\nsystolic falls, this is a sign of failing heart.\n\nNewburgh and Minot [Footnote: Newburgh, L.

They found that\n\"low systolic pressures are not invariably of evil omen.\" They also\nfound that the systolic pressure in fatal cases is often higher than\nin those in which the patients recovered, and they found that the\nrate of the pulse is more important in determining the treatment\nthan the blood pressure measurements.\n\nThe work which has been described under this section is of interest\nas indicating the newer experimental work on the physiology of blood\npressure. Much of it is new, however, and it is difficult to draw\nabsolute therapeutic conclusions from the evidence offered.\n\n\nTHE EFFECT OF DRUGS ON BLOOD PRESSURE\n\nFree catharsis is a well established and valuable method of\nrelieving the heart in many cases of broken compensation, and in\ncases with high blood pressure even while compensation is still\ngood, salines administered once or twice a week assist in\nelimination, and in the reduction of blood pressure.\n\nHowever, profuse purging in heart disease may be followed by\nunfavorable symptoms, especially when the systolic blood pressure is\nlow. When there is hypotension, or when the diastolic pressure is\nhigh and the venous pressure is high, and when there is edema or\neffusion, watery catharsis should be caused only after due\nconsideration, and always with a careful watching of the effect on\nthe heart and blood pressure. The blood pressure is lowered by such\ncatharsis, and the heart is often slowed. Neilson and Hyland\n[Footnote: Neilson, C. H., and Hyland, R.

They think that the\nslowing of the heart after such purging may be, due to an increased\nviscosity of the blood, or perhaps to a reflex irritation from the\npurgative on the intestinal canal.\n\nPilcher and Sollmann [Footnote: Pilcher and Sollmann: Jour.\nPharmacol. and Exper. Therap., 1913, vi, 323.] have shown that the\nfall of blood pressure after the administration of nitrites is\nmostly due to the action of these drugs on the peripheral vessels.\nChloroform, of course, depressed the vasomotor center, but ether had\nno effect on this center, or slightly stimulated it. Such\nstimulation, however, Pilcher and Sollmann believe may be secondary\nto asphyxia. Nicotin they found to cause intense stimulation of the\nvasomotor center. Ergot and hydrastis and its alkaloids seem to have\nno effect on the vasomotor center. Strophanthus acted on this center\nonly moderately, and digitalis very slightly, if at all. Camphor in\ndoses large enough to cause convulsions stimulated the vasomotor\ncenter. In smaller doses it generally stimulated the center\nmoderately, but not always. Even when this center was stimulated,\nhowever, the camphor did not necessarily increase the blood\npressure. The rise in blood pressure from epinephrin is due entirely\nto its action on the peripheral blood vessels and the heart. It has\nno action on the vasomotor center. They found that strychnin in\nlarge doses may stimulate the vasomotor center moderately, but\nusually it did not act on this center unless the patient was\nasphyxiated; then it acted intensely. The conclusion to be drawn\nfrom their experiments is that when there is asphyxia, increased\nvenous pressure, and also a rising blood pressure from the\nstimulation of carbon dioxid, strychnin is contraindicated.\n\nIt should be recognized that digitalis very frequently not only does\nnot raise blood pressure, but also may lower it; especially in\naortic insufficiency and when there is cyanosis. Even with some\nforms of angina pectoris, digitalis in small doses may reduce the\nfrequency of the pain. This decrease of pain following the use of\ndigitalis has in some cases been ascribed to the improvement of\ncoronary circulation and resulting better nutrition of heart muscle.\nOf course under these conditions the action of digitalis must be\ncarefully watched, and it should not be given too long.\n\nAlthough sodium nitrite and nitroglycerin have but a short period of\naction, in laboratory experimentation, in lowering the blood\npressure, when given repeatedly four or five times a day the blood\npressure is lowered in very many instances by these drugs.

It may cause a slight rise, or\nit may cause a slight fall, but changes in pressure with ether are\nnot marked. When there is slight surgical shock present, as from\nsome injury, they found that chloroform would lower the pressure\nconsiderably. Hence it would seem that chloroform should not be used\nas an anesthetic after serious injuries.\n\n\nTHE EFFECT OF DRUGS ON VENOUS BLOOD PRESSURE\n\nCapps and Matthews [Footnote: Capps, J. A., and Matthews, S. A.:\nVenous Blood Pressure as influenced by the Drugs Employed in\nCardiovascular Therapy, THE JOURNAL A. M. A., Aug. 9, 1913, p. 388.]\nhave shown that even with first class preparations of digitalis,\nthere may be only a moderate gradual rise in arterial pressure, but\nnot much change in venous pressure. Venous pressure was not much\naffected by small doses of epinephrin, but with large doses it rose\nfrom 10 to 80 mm. Pituitary extract acts somewhat similarly to\nepinephrin. Caffein, though raising the arterial pressure, did not\ninfluence the venous pressure. Strychnin did not raise either\npressure until the dose was sufficient to cause muscular\ncontractions. They found that the nitrites caused a fall in venous\npressure as well as arterial pressure, although the heart might be\naccelerated and more regular. They think that the nitrites act by\ndepressing the nerve endings in the veins as well as the arteries.\nMorphin they found did not act on the venous pressure, although it\nlowered arterial tension, in ordinary doses of 1/8 or 1/6 grain; but\nwith doses of from 1/4 to 1/2 grain, both arterial and venous\npressures were lowered. They found that alcohol in ordinary doses\ndid not influence the venous pressure, although it lowered the\narterial pressure; but very large doses lowered the arterial and\nraised the venous pressure. They think that when the venous pressure\nis increased only by large doses of epinephrin, pituitary extract\nand alcohol, the effect is due to failure of the heart, although it\nmay be due to an increase of carbon dioxid in the blood, in other\nwords, to asphyxia.\n\n\n\n\nHYPERTENSION\n\n\nArterial hypertension may be divided into stages.

In the first stage\nthe arteries are healthy, but the tone, owing to contraction of the\nmuscular walls, is too great. This condition or stage has been\ntermed \"chronic arterial hypertension.\" This condition may be due to\nirritants circulating in the blood, to nervous tension, to incipient\nchronic interstitial nephritis, or may be the first stage of\nsclerosis of the arteries. If from any cause this hypertension\npersists, the muscular coats of the arteries will become more or\nless hypertrophied, and sooner or later degenerative changes begin\nin the intima, and finally fibrosis occurs in the external coat of\nthe arteries; in other words, arteriosclerosis is in evidence. If\nthe patient lives with this arteriosclerosis, a later stage of the\narterial disease may occur which has been termed atheroma, with\nthickening, and possibly calcareous deposits in some parts of the\nwalls of the vessels, while in other parts the coats become thinner\nand insufficient. At this stage the heart, which has already shown\nsome trouble, becomes unable to force the blood properly against\nthis enormous resistance of inelastic vessels and the blood pressure\nbegins to fail as the left ventricle weakens.\n\nEdema, failing heart, perhaps aneurysms, peripheral obstruction, or\nhemorrhages are the final conditions in this chronic disease of\narteriosclerosis.\n\nRiesman [Footnote: Riesman: Pennsylvania Med. Jour., December, 1911,\np. 193.] divides hypertension into four classes hypertension without\napparent nephritis or arterial disease; hypertension with\narteriosclerosis; hypertension with nephritis, and hypertension with\nboth arteriosclerosis and nephritis. These classes are given here in\nthe order of the seriousness of the prognosis.\n\n\nETIOLOGY\n\nOne of the most common causes of hypertension is clue to excess of\neating and drinking. The products caused by maldigestion of\nproteins, and the toxins formed and absorbed especially from meat\nproteins, particularly when the excretions are insufficient, are the\nmost frequent causes of hypertension. Whatever other element or\ncondition may have caused increased blood pressure, the first step\ntoward improving and lowering this pressure is to diminish the\namount of meat eaten or to remove it entirely from the diet. In\npregnancy where there is increased metabolic change, when the\nproteins are not well or properly cared for in gout, and when there\nis intestinal fermentation or putrefaction, hypertension is likely\nto occur. The increased blood pressure in these cases is directly\ndue to irritation of the toxins on the blood vessel walls.\n\nWhile alcohol does not tend to raise arterial blood pressure, in\nlarge amounts it may raise the venous pressure. Also, by causing an\nabundant appetite and thus increasing the amount of food taken, by\ninterfering with the activity of the liver, and by impairing the\nintestinal digestion, it can indirectly disturb the metabolism and\ncause enough toxin to be produced to raise the blood pressure.\n\nAny drug or substance that raises the blood pressure by stimulating\nthe vasomotor center or the arterioles, when constantly repeated,\nwill be a cause of hypertension. This is particularly true", "doc_id": "254f9bf5-4ac6-40b4-92da-d8b9a855919d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "60fe38f5f3407452750e4b409289d12cc1c37a21322fec419a4d15d8ab70171f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 141823, "end": 145645}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "ef734cb9-87b8-4164-b4c6-2389e46e62a8", "3": "67f98d95-3a51-4186-9c51-c49e7129bc6c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "67f98d95-3a51-4186-9c51-c49e7129bc6c": {"__data__": {"text": "intestinal fermentation or putrefaction, hypertension is likely\nto occur.

Also, by causing an\nabundant appetite and thus increasing the amount of food taken, by\ninterfering with the activity of the liver, and by impairing the\nintestinal digestion, it can indirectly disturb the metabolism and\ncause enough toxin to be produced to raise the blood pressure.\n\nAny drug or substance that raises the blood pressure by stimulating\nthe vasomotor center or the arterioles, when constantly repeated,\nwill be a cause of hypertension. This is particularly true of\ncaffein and nicotin. Also, anything that might stimulate, or that\ndoes stimulate, the suprarenal glands will cause a continued high\nblood pressure. It is quite probable that in many cases of gout the\nsuprarenals are hypersecreting and it has been shown by Cannon, Aub\nand Binger [Footnote: Cannon, Aub and Binger: Jour. Pharmacol. and\nExper. Therap., March, 1912.] that nicotin in small closes increases\nthe suprarenal secretion. Therefore, nicotin becomes a decided cause\nof hypertension and arteriosclerosis.\n\nThayer found that heavy work is the cause of about two thirds of all\ncases of arteriosclerosis, and one of the functions of the\nsuprarenals is to destroy the waste products of muscular activity;\nhence these glands, in these cases, are hypersecreting. Furthermore,\nthe reason that many infections are followed later by arterio-\nsclerosis may be the fact that the suprarenals have been stimulated\nto hypertrophy and hypersecrete.\n\nMany persons in middle life, and especially women at the time of the\nmenopause, show hypertension without arterial or kidney reason. At\nthis time of life the thyroid is disturbed, and often, especially if\nweight is added, it is not secreting sufficiently. Whether, with the\npolyglandular disturbance of the menopause the suprarenals are\nexcited and hypersecreting, or whether they are simply relatively\nsecreting more vasopressor substance than is combated by the\nvasodilator substance from the thyroid, cannot be determined. These\nwomen are energetic, and look full of health and full of strength,\nbut their faces frequently flush, sometimes they are dizzy, and the\nsystolic blood pressure is too high. Reisman has pointed out that\nthese patients are likely to have very large breasts, and there is\nreason to believe that we must begin to study more carefully the\neffect of large breasts on the metabolism of girls and women. There\ncertainly is an internal secretion of some importance furnished by\nthese glands.\n\nIn hyperthyroidism at first the blood pressure may be lowered on\naccount of the increased physiologic secretion of the thyroid gland.\nLater the blood pressure may be raised by stimulation of the\nsuprarenals, or it may become raised from the irritated and\nstimulated heart becoming hypertrophied. If the heart is normal the\nventricles should hypertrophy with the increased work that they are\nunder; and the blood pressure could increase for this reason. Later\nin exophthalmic goiter the heart muscle may become degenerated, a\nchronic myocarditis, and the ventricles may slightly dilate. At this\ntime the blood pressure is lowered. When such a condition has\noccurred, the heart bears thyroidectomy badly; hence an operation on\nthis gland should, if possible, be performed before the heart muscle\nhas become injured. If the heart shows signs of loss of power, minor\noperations to cut off the blood supply of the thyroid should first\nbe done, and the patient's heart allowed to improve before a\nthyroidectomy is performed.\n\nMen with hypertension without kidney or arterial excuse are likely\nto have been athletes, or to have done some severe competitive work,\nor, as above stated,", "doc_id": "67f98d95-3a51-4186-9c51-c49e7129bc6c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8033029b8891d424e94e22aad31f977b38b96de1d1fb34cf3fc07446f68bf724", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 145587, "end": 149501}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "254f9bf5-4ac6-40b4-92da-d8b9a855919d", "3": "b7173606-2470-4fb6-b005-e25ef6b384d4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7173606-2470-4fb6-b005-e25ef6b384d4": {"__data__": {"text": "blood pressure could increase for this reason.

There may be dizziness, or\nno head symptoms at all. Nicotin is likely to be an etiologic factor\nin this class.\n\nThese women and these men may all be improved by proper treatment,\nand the condition may not develop into arteriosclerosis or\nnephritis.\n\nNeurotic conditions, and in some instances neurasthenic conditions,\nmay show a blood pressure higher than normal. Lead may be a cause of\nincreased blood pressure, and diabetics occasionally have a high\npressure, although more frequently there is a lowering of blood\npressure in diabetes.\n\nRichman believes that syphilis is the most common cause of\nhypertension and arteriosclerosis without renal disease. When\narteriosclerosis and renal disease are combined, of course the\nhighest systolic readings occur. He thinks that when high tension\noccurs under 40 years of age, kidney disease is generally the cause.\nOf course it may be the only cause later in life.\n\nHigh blood pressure due to syphilitic conditions may be greatly\nimproved by the proper treatment, although some one or more blood\nvessels are likely to have been seriously damaged. Although these\npatients may live for many years, they are likely to have an\napoplexy, cerebral disease or an aneurysm.\n\nWhile hypertension is not a disease, and while it often should not\nbe combated, still, as it is always the forerunner of more serious\ntrouble, there can be no excuse for not most seriously considering\nit and generally attempting its reduction. At the moment high\ntension is discovered, there may be no special symptoms; but\ntroublesome symptoms are always pending, and while the patient need\nnot be unduly alarmed, there is no excuse for not rearranging the\nindividual's life so as to prolong it. This is not to state that\nevery high tension must be lowered, but every hypertension must be\nstudied and a safer systolic pressure caused if it is possible\nwithout interfering with the person's efficiency. A high diastolic\npressure, one above 105, certainly must receive immediate attention,\nand a diastolic pressure of 110 must be lowered, if possible. On the\nother hand, a high systolic pressure without a high diastolic\npressure should not be rapidly lowered, else depression will be\ncaused.\n\n\nSYMPTOMS\n\nIn hypertension, as long as the heart, which is probably\nhypertrophied, remains perfectly competent, there are few symptoms,\nand the person does not seek advice until he notices one or more of\nseveral possible conditions.

On the\nother hand, a high systolic pressure without a high diastolic\npressure should not be rapidly lowered, else depression will be\ncaused.\n\n\nSYMPTOMS\n\nIn hypertension, as long as the heart, which is probably\nhypertrophied, remains perfectly competent, there are few symptoms,\nand the person does not seek advice until he notices one or more of\nseveral possible conditions. He may be dizzy, his head may feel full\nand tight, he may have headaches, or he may have some cardiac pain\nor distress. Other persons do not seek advice until there is a\nslight weakening of the heart, showing the strain under which it is\nlaboring. In most of these high tension cases, the patients have\nrather a slow heart, provided the heart is sufficient. Eyster and\nHooker [Footnote: Eyster and Hooker: Am. Jour. Physiol., May, 1908.]\nfound that the slowing of the heart in high blood pressure is due to\naction through the vagus nerves either from the inhibitory center in\nthe medulla or reflexly by stimulation of the peripheral nerves of\nthe vessels.\n\nAnother symptom for which the patient frequently seeks advice is\nthat he is unable to relax from his business cares, when off duty.\nHe also finds that he works at a higher tension, and that coffee and\ntea, alcohol and tobacco stimulate him more than usual. He sleeps\nrestlessly, and dreams at night. He has an increased frequency of\nurination in the morning, especially after taking coffee, and\nsometimes gets up once or twice at night to urinate. He is irritable\nat times; short breathed on exertion, and sometimes has indigestion.\nHe may have pains or aches in his heart. He may find that he\ndislikes to lie on his left side.\n\nHowever much it may upset the patient and render him more nervous to\ninform him that his blood pressure is too high, it is necessary to\ngive him this information. People now suspect the condition, and\nthey frequently seek their physicians to determine if the blood\npressure is too high and, from reading health journals, more or less\nrealize some of the things, at least, that must be done to decrease\nthe pressure. Consequently, the very things that are advised or\nordered give the patient the diagnosis, whether he is told directly\nor not. Hence, we must talk freely with the patient, much as we do\nin heart defects, and get his cooperation, stating how frequent the\ncondition is, how often it is readily improved, and how little it\nmay interfere with long life.\n\nWiener and Wolfner [Footnote: Wiener, Meyer, and Wolfner, M.

Of course\nthe most important concomitant symptoms of high pressure are\ncardiac, renal, and cerebral, and the typical headache, as he terms\nit, is a symptom of serious import. In considering headache in\npersons over 40, we must eliminate the eye headaches produced by the\nneed of presbyopic glasses or by the need of stronger lenses, as\nthis need is a frequent cause of headache. Dizziness and vertigo may\noccur without headache, and drowsiness, though not so frequent a\nsymptom as insomnia, often occurs.\n\nJaneway finds that all kinds of apoplectic attacks may occur from\nsimple transient aphasia to complete hemiplegia, and thirteen of his\npatients who had died and thirteen of those living at the time of\nthis report showed failure of eyesight as an initial symptom of\narterial disease.\n\nJaneway deplores the too frequent diagnosis of neurasthenia in these\npatients. This diagnosis probably accounts for the frequency with\nwhich neurasthenics have been said to have high blood pressure.\nPatients with high blood pressure may show all kinds of symptoms\nsimulating neurasthenia, but hypertension is a much better diagnosis\nthan neurasthenia for such patients, and will lead to more rational\ntreatment.\n\nNinety-seven of these patients had hemorrhages somewhere, most\nfrequently epistaxes, sometimes hemoptysis. Janeway did not find\nthat purpuric spots on the skin occurred early in the disease in any\nof his patients.\n\nGastro-intestinal disturbances were not much in evidence unless the\nkidneys were insufficient. Intermittent claudication in the legs\noccasionally occurred. While angina pectoris and edema of the lungs\nwere not infrequent causes of death in men, it was a rare cause of\ndeath in women. Dyspnea is a frequent symptom, and one for which\nmany patients seek medical advice.\n\nA constant systolic blood pressure of over 200 shows a probability\nthat the patient will ultimately die either of uremia or of\napoplexy. Janeway found that those patients who are to die from\ncardiac weakness show cardiac symptoms early in their disease. He\nfound that rapid continuous loss of weight pointed to an early fatal\ntermination.\n\nOf the 212 patients who had died, seventy-one had shown cardiac\ninsufficiency at the time of the first examination; twenty-one\nshowed albumin or casts at that time. Of course it should be\nrepeatedly emphasized that chronic interstitial nephritis may be in\nevidence with either albumin or casts alone, or without either being\npresent.\n\nJaneway sums up his conclusions by stating that \"from the time of\nthe development of symptoms indicative of cardiovascular or renal\ndisease, four years will witness the death of half the men and five\nyears of half the women.

Heart pains comprise another\nimportant indicator of future cardiac death, perhaps not an angina.\nNocturnal polyuria would indicate a uremic death in about 50 percent\nof the patients, and typical headache or cerebral symptoms show the\nprobability of uremic death in more than 50 percent, and death from\napoplexy in a large number of the other 50 percent As just stated,\nrapid loss of weight is a bad symptom.\n\nJaneway [Footnote: Janeway, T. C.: A Study of the Causes of Death in\nOne Hundred Patients with High Blood Pressure, THE JOURNAL A. M. A.,\nDec. 14, 1912, p. 2106.] has previously reported seven patients with\nhypertension who had diabetes. Diabetes generally, on the other\nhand, causes a low blood pressure. Patients with this trouble and\nwith hypertension, and without nephritis, probably have an increased\nsecretion from the suprarenals.\n\nWe may sum up the prognosis in hypertension as follows: Hypertension\nalone is not of unfavorable omen; if it is not readily reduced by\nordinary means, it is more serious. If associated with kidney, heart\nor liver defect, it is most serious. If there are such serious\nconditions as edema, ascites, lung congestion, cyanosis and great\ndyspnea, the prognosis is dire.\n\nObesity being a cause of high blood pressure, it should be treated\nmore or less energetically, even if the individual does not continue\nto add weight.\n\nStone [Footnote: Stone, W. J.: The Differentiation of Cerebral and\nCardiac Types of Hyperarterial Tension in Vascular Disease, Arch.\nInt. Med., November, 1915, p. 775.] believes that the higher the\ndiastolic pressure the greater danger there is of cerebral death,\nwhile a patient with a very high systolic, but a diastolic pressure\nof 100 or lower, is in more danger of cardiac death. He urges a\ngreater consideration of the pressure pulse in determining the load\nof the heart and the great danger from a sustained diastolic\npressure of over 105 as sooner or later bound to cause myocardial\nsymptoms. This load of the heart is also shown by an increased pulse\nrate and increased respiratory efforts. In cardiac failure, as the\nsystolic pressure falls the diastolic is likely to be increased, and\nthe pressure pulse thus diminishing, allows insufficient blood to go\nto the medullary centers, and death soon occurs. Therefore, in acute\nillnesses a sustained pressure pulse gives a better prognosis than a\ndiminishing pressure pulse. The strenuous measures that should he\nused to lower a high diastolic pressure are contraindicated when the\ndiastolic pressure is already low, even if the systolic pressure 1s\nhigh. If a high systolic pressure begins to fall more or less\nrapidly the heart shows fatigue, and should be stimulated by\ndigitalis or strophanthin.\n\nRowan [Footnote: Rowan, J.

A., March 18, 1916, p. 873.]\nfinds that a diastolic reading of 100 mm. or more usually means that\nthere is a narrowing of the lumen of the vessels, owing to\nstimulation of the vasoconstrictors, although it may mean the\nexistence of a true arterial fibrosis. While a real atheroma\ngenerally causes a reduction in diastolic blood pressure, or at\nleast but slight increase, he has found in syphilitic cases with\narteriosclerosis a high diastolic pressure. If the blood pressure\ncannot be reduced by ordinary measures, arteriosclerosis is probably\npresent. Several blood pressure examinations must be made, while the\npatient is being treated, to establish the diagnosis.\n\nRowan finds the reading of the pulse pressure to be of great\nimportance, as this will indicate, sometimes before any other\nsymptom is present, that the patient is either improving or doing\nbadly, and it also aids in indicating the proper medicinal\ntreatment.\n\nIn arteriosclerosis the systolic pressure may be high while the\ndiastolic is low; hence there is a large pressure pulse. If the\nheart becomes weak the systolic pressure will drop, and any\nimprovement caused, especially in aortic regurgitation, is by an\nincrease of the systolic pressure.\n\nRowan finds, as has long been recognized, that a conclusion as to\nwhether or not cerebral hemorrhage will occur cannot be made from\nthe condition of the radial arteries, as patients with soft radials\nmay suffer from cerebral hemorrhage, while those \"with hard,\nsclerosed, pipestem-like arteries may live to a great age and die of\nanything rather than apoplexy.\"\n\nSwan, [Footnote: Swan: Interstate Med. Jour., March, 1915, p. 186.]\nhas studied the blood pressure in fifty cases of disturbed thyroid,\nand finds that functional myocardial tests show that the myocardium\nis nearly always disturbed in these patients.\n\nBefore taking up the subject of treatment of high blood pressure, it\nmay be suggested that a high diastolic pressure with a falling\nsystolic pressure may require vasodilators on the one hand or\ncardiac tonics on the other, and sometimes the decision can be made\nonly by proper tests. In other words, if the diastolic pressure is\nlowered the heart will be relieved. On the other hand, if the\ndiastolic is being raised by an increased venous pressure from a\nfailing heart, digitalis, strychnin and caffein may be of benefit in\nlowering the diastolic as well as raising the systolic. However, if\nthere is a high systolic and a low diastolic pressure, vasodilators\nare often contraindicated.\n\n\nTREATMENT\n\nIn this rapid high tension age the physician should be as energetic\nin teaching prevention of arterial hypertension as he is in\npreventing contagion. As infectious diseases are reduced in\nfrequency, more patients live to die of diseases later in life, and\n(as previously stated) diseases with hypertension are on the\nincrease. It is therefore the duty of the physician to urge youths\nand adults to abstain from all kinds of excesses so common in this\nage.

We\nmust take better care of patients during their convalescence from\nsome serious illness lest they have circulatory debility by becoming\nstrenuous too soon after their recovery. The pregnant woman must be\nmore carefully watched, not only for her own sake, but also for the\nsake of her child. Intestinal indigestion, while not the cause of\nall disturbances that occur in man after 40, is still an important\nelement in his deterioration and degeneration, and it should be\nprevented if possible.\n\nThe tendency for hypertension and arteriosclerosis to occur early in\nlife in patients who have suffered some serious acute infection,\nwhether blood poisoning, typhoid fever, or other, shows that in all\nprobability in these acute illnesses the internal secretions are so\ndisturbed that the suprarenal activity is greater than normal, while\nthe thyroid activity may be less than normal, and hypertension is\nthe consequence. Therefore, these infected patients who recover\nshould probably have a longer convalescence in order for the more\ndelicate structures of the body, such as the internal secreting\nglands, to have a better chance to recover and become normal.\n\nThe enumeration of these causes and the causes that have been\nmentioned before not only suggest, but also direct the treatment of\nhypertension after it has occurred. The most important of all\ntreatment for hypertension is rest. That means for an individual,\nwell except for his hypertension, a vacation, that is, a rest from\nphysical and mental labor. For a patient who is in serious trouble\nfrom hypertension, bed rest is the most important element in the\nmanagement. As has been previously shown, good sleep lowers the\nblood pressure, and Brooks and Carroll [Footnote: Brooks, Harlow,\nand Carroll, J. H.; A Clinical Study of the Effects of Sleep and\nRest on Blood Pressure, Arch. Int. Med., August, 1912, p. 97.]\nshowed that the greatest drop in blood pressure occurs in the first\npart of the night's sleep. In other words, a patient who lies awake\nlong loses the best part of his night's rest as far as his\ncirculation is concerned. This is one more reason for abstinence\nfrom tea and coffee in the evening by those patients who are at all\ndisturbed by the caffein. On the other hand, patients who are not\nseriously ill should not remain for days in bed, as the blood\npressure does not tend to continue to fall, although the heart may\nbecome weakened by such bed rest.

Such patients probably need more food.\nIt is also well, in hypertension cases, to have one day a week in\nwhich a very minimum amount of food is taken, whether that be milk,\nor skimmed milk, or a small amount of carbohydrate, without protein\nfood.\n\nIf the foregoing management does not reduce hypertension, the\nkidneys are generally beginning to become involved in the sclerotic\ndegeneration, whether the urine shows such a condition or not. On\nthe other hand, there are exceptions to this rule.\n\nAs indican in the urine gives evidence of putrefactive changes in\nthe intestines and the probability of the absorption of toxins from\nthe intestines, although we have no real proof that these toxins are\nthe direct cause of hypertension, our patient is undoubtedly\nphysically better, and will have less arterial tension when this\nintestinal condition is removed. Therefore, our treatment of the\nindividual is not a success as long as such fermentation and\nputrefaction persist. If such putrefaction cannot be removed by diet\nand laxatives and mental rest and the prevention of physical\nstrenuosity, radical changes in diet are advisable, although it may\nnot be necessary to continue such a diet more than a few days at a\ntime. A rigid milk diet for a few days may change the flora of the\nintestine completely; then a vegetable diet may be given, with\nreturn to a mixed diet; or the various lactic acid bacilli may be\ngiven, or one of the various fermented milks may be the diet, the\nobject being to change the flora in the intestine and thus modify\nthe ferments. So-called bowel antiseptics, such as salol, for a\nshort time may be of advantage. Colon washings may be of great\nadvantage. Liquid petroleum may be advantageous.\n\nBesides preventing the absorption of toxins from the intestine, we\nmust prevent such absorption from any latent infection. The most\nfrequent kind of such infection is pyorrhea alveolaris.\n\nA simple method that sometimes is an efficient aid in lowering the\nblood pressure is complete muscular and mental relaxation. The\npatient lies down for a while in the middle of the day and relaxes\nevery muscle of his body. With this he may take slow breathing\nexercises. He should be in a dark room, quiet if possible, and\nalone, and should teach his brain to be for a short time mentally\ninert.\n\nThe physical methods of lowering the blood pressure are\nhydrotherapeutic, whether by warm baths or more strenuously by\nTurkish baths, by hot air baths (body baking) which is occasionally\nvery efficient, or, perhaps more now in vogue, by electric light\nbaths. The duration of these baths, and the frequency, must be\ndetermined by the results.

The duration of these baths, and the frequency, must be\ndetermined by the results. If the heart is made rapid, and the heart\nmuscle shows signs of weakness, the duration of these baths must not\nbe long, and they may be contraindicated. These baths are most\nefficient in lowering the blood pressure when the patient reclines\nfor several hours after the bath. The amount of sweating that is\nadvisable in these cases depends on the condition of the heart. If\nthe heart muscle is insufficient, profuse sweating is inadvisable.\nAlso if the kidneys are insufficient, profuse sweating is\ninadvisable as tending to concentrate the toxins in the blood. On\nthe other hand, when the surface of the body tends to be cool, and\nthere are internal congestions, the value of these baths is very\ngreat. Sometimes the electric light baths increase the tension\ninstead of diminishing it, and when properly used they may be of\nbenefit in some cases of hypotension. The frequency of the baths and\nthe question of how many weeks they should be intermittently\ncontinued, depend on the individual case. After a course of such\ntreatment sometimes patients have a diminished systolic blood\npressure not only for weeks, but even for months, provided they do\nnot break the rules laid down for them.\n\nThe Nauheim baths, while stated not to raise the blood pressure, are\nnot much advocated in hypertension, and Brown [Footnote: Brown:\nCalifornia State Jour. Med., November, 1907, p. 279.] who made more\nthan 500 observations of patients of all ages, found that the full\nstrength Nauheim bath would raise the blood pressure in all feverish\nand circulatory conditions. He also found that a fifteen minute\nsodium chlorid bath, 7 pounds to 40 gallons, at a temperature of\nfrom 94 to 98 degrees F., lowered the pressure from 10 to 15 mm.\nThis is not different from the effect obtained from a fifteen minute\nwarm bath at from 94 to 98 degrees F., or a fifteen minute mustard\nbath of the same temperature. In other words, the slight irritation\nof mustard or of salt in a warm bath made no special difference in\nthe amount of lowering of the blood pressure. On the other hand, he\nfound that a fifteen minute calcium chlorid bath, 1 1/2 pounds to 40\ngallons, at 94 degrees F., raised the blood pressure 15 mm.\n\nThe autocondensation treatment to lower the blood pressure is not so\nsatisfactory as it was hoped to be. The blood pressure can thus be\nlowered, but it soon again rises, and probably generally more\nrapidly than after the bath treatments, and in some persons it\ncauses considerable depression.

The temperature may rise. The\nexcretion of the urinary solids is mostly increased. Perspiration\nmay be caused, and he believes the glandular activities are\nincreased. In a word, metabolic changes in the body are made more\nactive and the blood pressure is lowered.\n\nBesides the effect of altitude on blood pressure, as previously\ndeclared, patients with dangerously high blood pressure should, if\npossible, not be subjected to intense cold. In other words, a person\nwith hyper-tension, if financially able, should not remain in a cold\nclimate during the winter. On the other hand, even if he is stout\nand feels sufficiently warm with light clothing during the winter,\nhis skin becoming chilled adds to his tension. Therefore he should\nbe clothed as warmly as he will tolerate.\n\nAfter a period which may be termed the normal period of hypertension\nin normal life, as age advances the systolic tension may lower,\nprovided there is no kidney lesion. This is due to the slowly\ndeveloping chronic myocarditis and a lessening of the tension and\ntherefore lessening of the resistance to the heart. This may be\nnature's method of lengthening the life of the individual. In other\nwords, as the arteries grow older the force of the heart slightly\nlessens, the blood pressure lowers, and the individual is safer.\nThis frequently occurs in otherwise perfectly normal individuals,\nwithout treatment.\n\nWhen the blood pressure is suddenly excessively high from any cause,\nvenesection may be life saving, and should perhaps be more\nfrequently done than it is. It may save a heart that is in agony\nfrom tension, and may prevent an apoplexy. It is of little value\nexcept temporarily in uremic conditions, but at other times it may,\nat the time, save life and allow other methods of reducing the\ndangerous tension to become effective. A chronic high tension\npatient may be repeatedly bled, although such treatment will not\nlong save life, as the blood pressure in many such cases soon\nreturns to its previous height.\n\nSome very high tension cases, especially in women at the menopause,\nand where there is no kidney involvement, have the blood pressure\nreduced successfully only by large doses of thyroid, sometimes well\ncombined with bromids, especially if the thyroid causes excitation.\nSuch treatment persisted in for a time may cause months of\nimprovement, and even years.\n\n\nDRUGS IN HYPERTENSION\n\nThe drugs that are mostly used to lower blood pressure are nitrites\nor drugs which are like nitrites, and these are nitroglycerin,\nsodium nitrite, erythroltetra nitrate and amyl nitrite, and the\nfrequency of their use is in the order named.

The dose of sodium nitrite is\nfrom 0.03 to 0.06 gm. (1/2 grain to a grain), best in tablet form\nand given with plenty of water. The tablet should of course be\ndissolved or crushed with the teeth. It should not be given on an\nempty stomach, as it may cause considerable irritation and pain. It\nmore or less actively lowers the blood pressure for about an hour.\n\nErythrol tetranitrate is preferred by some clinicians who find that\nits effect lasts somewhat longer. There is probably, however, no\nbetter nitrite or nitrate than nitroglycerin. While it acts but a\nshort time, it acts effectively, and although no nitrite has\nvasodilating effects for any length of time from one dose, when the\ndoses are given repeatedly and for days at a time, the blood\npressure will generally be more or less reduced. The dose is from\n1/500 to 1/100 grain, three or four times a day, or every three\nhours, as desired. The best form in which to use it is in a very\nsoluble tablet, and the tablet should not be dissolved unless\nintense immediate action is desired. It acts when absorbed from the\ntongue almost as rapidly as when given hypodermically; it acts in\ntwo or three minutes, and the blood pressure may drop from 20 to 30\nmm. In experimental tests the action does not last more than from\nfifteen minutes to half an hour, but clinically the effect of\nrepeated doses is much more satisfactory. Spirit of glyceryl\ntrinitrate or spirit of Nitroglycerin, dose 1 minim, keeps well if\ncare is taken to guard against evaporation of alcohol; tablets if\nwell made and kept in bottles properly corked, will retain their\nactivity for months.\n\nThe closer a physician is to the laboratory, the less he believes in\nthe value of nitroglycerin in hypertension. The nearer he is to\nclinical work the more he believes in it. It is a fact that in some\ninstances, even with a dose as small as 1/200 grain of\nnitroglycerin, three or four times in twenty-four hours, the blood\npressure will be lower, whatever the diet is and whatever the other\ntreatments are, than if the patient does not take the nitroglycerin.\nAlso the value of these short relaxation periods from the standpoint\nof a strained and tired heart should not be underestimated, the same\nas the value of a night's rest, or the value of a recreation period\nof an hour or two. If a patient has hypotension and a systolic\npressure of 110, and is given nitroglycerin, the very unpleasant\nresults from its administration will be immediately noticed. Hence\nnitroglycerin is one of the most valuable drugs that we possess for\nthe treatment of hypertension, and some patients are even benefited\nby as small a dose as l/500 grain. Lawrence [Footnote: Lawrence, C.\nH.: The Effect of Pressure-Lowering Drugs and Therapeutic Measures\non Systolic and Diastolic Pressure in Man, Arch. Int.

(1-1/2\nto 3 grains) given from once to three times a day, after meals\n(these small doses do not disturb the stomach), will stimulate the\nthyroid gland to greater activity, and when this gland secretes\nproperly, the blood pressure is somewhat lowered. Of course, in\nsyphilitic sclerosis large doses of iodids are indicated and are\nvaluable.\n\nIn obese patients with hypertension, in the hypertension of women at\nthe menopause, and in hypertension with insufficient kidneys,\nthyroid medication is often of great value. Sometimes a small dose\nof from 0.1 to 0.2 gm. (1 1/12 to 3 grains) once a day is all that\nis needed. At other times, especially when there is no marked\narteriosclerosis and no marked kidney or liver lesion, very high\nblood pressures are reduced only by very large doses, even as much\nas 10 grains a day. Such treatment is often of very great benefit.\nOf course, if one of the persons under consideration has symptoms of\nhyperthyroidism, or if small doses of thyroid cause palpitation, the\ntreatment is not indicated, on the one hand, and should be stopped,\non the other. Sometimes when the blood pressure cannot be reduced,\nin these cases without apparent organic lesions, and thyroid\ntreatment is more or less successful, but at the same time causes\ngreat excitation, it may be combined with bromid medication, and\nthen the benefit is sometimes very great.\n\nA patient who cannot sleep and who has hypertension may receive\nbromids if he is very irritable or if there are symptoms of thyroid\nirritability; but the most successful sleep and lowering of blood\npressure is caused by chloral. A dose of 0.5 gm. (7 1/2 grains) at\nnight is generally sufficient and need not be long continued.\nChloral has been frequently given to reduce pressure in 0.2 to 0.25\ngm.

It does show, especially\nif the systolic pressure is below normal for the age of the person,\na lack of reserve power, and such patients will not well stand\nserious illnesses, operations, injuries or serious physical and\nmental strains. If there is a low systolic pressure and a high\ndiastolic pressure, this shows impairment of the heart, whether or\nnot any other organic lesion is present.\n\nGenerally speaking, a low systolic pressure shows a weak acting\nheart muscle, and a very low diastolic pressure shows a dilated\ncondition of the arterioles. In aortic regurgitation this low\ndiastolic pressure is constantly in evidence, and, if the systolic\npressure is not below normal, does not signify that the circulation\nis insufficient. If the systolic pressure is not very low but the\ndiastolic is high, vasodilator drugs, by lowering the diastolic and\nincreasing the pulse pressure, are often of benefit. If there is\nincreased venous congestion and increased venous pressure and a high\ndiastolic pressure with a low systolic pressure, digitalis not only\nwill often raise the systolic pressure, but also will lower\ndiastolic by improving the general circulation and removing venous\ncongestion.\n\nWhile intestinal indigestion and absorption of toxins often tend to\nraise the blood pressure, some toxins thus absorbed, especially of\nthe ptomain variety, lower blood pressure and cause shock, perhaps\nby weakening the muscle of the heart or by acting on the vasodilator\nvessels; or they may cause dilation of the vessels of the abdomen\nand in this manner lower blood pressure.\n\nVery low blood pressure after exertion, after severe physical\nexercise, or after competitive athletic tests shows that the heart\ncannot sustain such strains and should not be again subjected to\nthem. In severe mental and physical strains the suprarenals may be\ninhibited in their activities, and a hypotension, more or less\nprolonged, may result.\n\nSewall [Footnote: Sewall: Am. Jour. Med. Sc., April, 1916, p. 491]\nbelieves that hypotension is frequently due to splanchnic stasis,\nand that sluggish circulation in this region, especially when the\nperson is in the erect posture, is an important factor in general\nphysiologic disturbances or lack of general tone. When the\nsplanchnic vessels are dilated there is also a lack of proper tone\nto the cerebral vessels, and this may be a cause of mental weariness\nand neurasthenia. While ptosis of organs in the abdomen and a\nflaccid condition of the musculature of the abdomen are frequent\ncauses of this splanchlnic stasis, and therefore hypotension,\nespecially in women, it is quite possible that suprarenal\ninsufficiency will allow this condition of the splanchnic vessels to\noccur frequently.\n\nSerious illness and infections will lower the blood pressure\nsometimes to a dangerous point.

Of course, hemorrhages lower the\nblood pressure. Shock and collapse cause lowering of blood pressure,\nfrequently to a fatal point, and Cornwall [Footnote: Cornwall: New\nYork Med. Jour. March 7, 1914, p. 470.] finds that a patient may\nlive several hours with a systolic pressure below 60, and several\ndays when it is below 70; that he may walk around with a systolic\npressure of 90, provided the pressure pulse is sufficiently large,\nthat is, that the diastolic pressure is low enough to cause a\ncirculation of blood. Of course, if the difference between the\nsystolic and the diastolic pressure is diminished to the vanishing\npoint, the patient cannot stand it, and dies. It should be\nremembered that just before death venous pressure is likely to rise,\nand this may raise the diastolic pressure.\n\nWith the progressive toxemia of typhoid fever the blood pressure\nwill become lowered from the myocardial degeneration. Of course, the\nblood pressure will drop suddenly from a hemorrhage, but Piersol\n[Footnote: Piersol: Pennsylvania Med. Jour., May, 1914, p. 625]\nfinds that with perforation the peritoneal irritation may cause a\nrise of blood pressure, and he thinks that this sign may precede for\nseveral hours more positive signs of the accident.\n\nAs in other infections, the blood pressure will fall in scarlet\nfever; but if it suddenly rises, a kidney complication is to be\nlooked for. The blood pressure always falls in diphtheria, and\nalways falls in acute rheumatism; consequently, strenuous sweating\nmeasures in the treatment of rheumatism should not be used as soon\nas the blood pressure has become low.\n\nFailing circulation in pneumonia, if accompanied by low blood\npressure, requires different treatment from the failure of\ncirculation in these cases when the blood pressure is high. Hence\nthe relationship of the systolic to the diastolic pressure in\npneumonia is of very great importance in deciding on the proper\ntreatment. In one instance the blood pressure must be lowered; in\nthe other, the heart must be stimulated.\n\nWhile tobacco, in ordinary conditions, raises the blood pressure,\nafter the heart has been seriously injured by the nicotin, the blood\npressure is likely to be found lower, and such patients are quickly\nbenefited by the withdrawal of the tobacco and the administration of\ndigitalis.\n\nAnemia almost invariably causes low blood pressure.

Jour. Physiol., 1910,\nxxvii, 158.] that hyperoxygenation and insufficient carbon dioxid\nmay be partially responsible for the condition should be remembered,\nand it has long been known that carbon dioxid congestion, as caused\nby laughing gas anesthesia, for instance, increases the blood\npressure.\n\nA systolic pressure of 110 mm. or lower in an adult should be\nconsidered hypotension, anything below 105 mm. calls for treatment,\nand a systolic pressure of 100 or lower in an adult calls for rest\nfrom all active duties.\n\nThese patients are weary, they have mental and physical tire, may\nget short breathed, may have palpitation of the heart, and often\nhave headaches and dizziness from imperfect circulation in the head.\nThere may be edemas of the legs and ankles toward night.

The treatment of dangerous sudden low\nblood pressure, as shock, will be discussed elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\nPERICARDITIS\n\nACUTE PERICARDITIS\n\n\nAs this inflammation is generally secondary to some other condition,\nits treatment cannot be positively outlined. Furthermore, it is\noften a terminal condition, and in such instances the results of\ntreatment are of necessity nil. The most frequent terminal cause is\nnephritis; other terminal causes are pulmonary tuberculosis,\nadjacent abscesses, cancer or other growth.\n\nThe most frequent infectious cause is rheumatism; other infectious\ncauses are cerebrospinal fever, typhoid fever, acute miliary\ntuberculosis, pneumonia and Sepsis. Accidental causes are traumatism\nand an adjacent inflammation of the pleura.\n\nThe result of an inflammation of the pericardium may be a fibrous\nexudate, or an exudate which is both serous and fibrous, or one in\nwhich pus is present in considerable amount.\n\nThe onset of pericarditis may be more or less acute, or it may\ncommence insidiously. For this reason, during severe illness, and\nespecially in those diseases which are known to have pericarditis\noften as a sequence, frequent examination of the heart should be\nmade as a routine procedure.\n\n\nSYMPTOMS AND SIGNS\n\nIf there is pain or much aching in the cardiac region, it tends to\ndisappear with the exudate, if such is to occur, in the same way as\ndoes the pain of pleurisy. If there is much exudate, the pressure on\nthe heart of course increases, the cardiac dulness enlarges, dyspnea\noccurs and even perhaps later cyanosis. As the exudate accumulates,\nthe patient must lie higher and higher in order that the fluid may\ngravitate to the lowest part of the sac and give the heart the\ngreatest ability to work. Reflex pain may occur from disturbances of\nthe pneumogastric nerve, or from the weight and pressure of the\nenlarged and heavy pericardium.

Reflex pain may occur from disturbances of\nthe pneumogastric nerve, or from the weight and pressure of the\nenlarged and heavy pericardium. Reflex vomiting may be a troublesome\nand distressing symptom.\n\nAcute pericarditis occurring in rheumatism, in acute infections, and\nfrom simple injuries tends to recovery. In dry pericarditis with\nserious adhesions, or if adhesions occur as a sequence of acute\npericarditis, the future prognosis is bad, as myocarditis may\ndevelop and sudden death or acute dilatation may occur. As stated\nabove, if pericarditis develops during the progress of chronic\ndisease, such as interstitial nephritis, or during sepsis, or from\nabscesses or growths in the region of the pericardium, the prognosis\nis bad.\n\n\nTREATMENT OF ACUTE PERICARDITIS\n\nIn acute pericarditis, absolute mental as well as physical rest is\nessential. Even if the patient does not appear to be seriously ill\nand has not much fever, he should not be allowed to have visitors,\nto discuss business matters, or to carry on any conversation,\nhowever little exciting. Anything which increases the heart beat\nincreases the irritation of the inflamed surfaces of the\npericardium. He should not be allowed to sit up, either to eat or to\nattend to the calls of Nature. These rules are imperative, and when\nthey are followed the pain is less, the heart beats less rapidly, is\nless hampered by pressure from whatever exudate may be present, and\nthe adhesions which are liable to form will be less in amount and\nless serious for the future work of the heart.\n\nThe treatment, of course, depends largely on the cause of the\npericarditis, as, if the cause is one of those just enumerated in\nwhich the prognosis is dire, any treatment directed toward the\npericardial inflammation is almost useless. The periearditis under\nthese conditions will be more or less benefited, if at all affected,\nby the treatment directed toward the cause.\n\nThe indications for treatment in all other instances are:\n\n1. To attempt to abort the inflammation.\n\n2. To stop the pain.\n\n3. To limit, if possible, the amount of exudate, and to diminish the\nexudate already present.\n\n4. To diminish the rapidity of the heart and to strengthen it.\n\n1. Abortive Treatment.--For many years bloodletting was considered\nof the greatest importance in the early treatment of this disease;\nbut owing to the fact that, except from traumatism, pericarditis\nrarely occurs except as a sequela of acute disease after the patient\nhas been sick along time, or as a terminal condition in a patient\nwho has long been chronically diseased and therefore has already\nlost more or less strength, venesection has been nearly abandoned.\nLeeches may be used over the region of the pericardium, and cups are\nsometimes used. Dry cupping is more frequently used. These measures\nsometimes seem to reduce the inflammation, and certainly often\nrelieve pain, but the most valuable local treatment is cold, which\nmay be applied either in the form of an ice bag or by a small coil\nthrough which ice water is caused to flow by siphonage.

Cold may be\napplied more or less continuously, depending on the sensations of\nthe patient. The bag or ice cap must not be overfilled and must not\nbe heavy, as the patient often cannot stand pressure over the\npericardium. Sometimes the relief from pain and the diminution of\nthe number of the heart beats is marked, and for this reason alone\nthe cardiac inflammation may be inhibited. If cold applications are\nnot tolerated by the patient (and they often are not in children)\nwarm applications may be used, such as an electric pad or cloths\nwrung out of hot water and covered with oiled silk, and the pain\nwill often be relieved thus. While hot applications would not tend\nto abort the inflammation, they probably do not tend to promote it.\n\nA diminished diet, of small amount at a time, and such purging as\nthe patient's strength will allow are essential in attempting to\nhasten recovery.\n\nJust what can be done locally or generally to combat the\ninflammation actively must depend on the cause. When the\ninflammation occurs as a complication of acute rheumatism, it has\nbeen suggested that salicylates, which arc not inhibiting rheumatism\nand may be depressant to the heart, should be stopped if they are\nbeing administered; but if the salicylates are apparently improving\nthe inflammation in the joints, pericarditis would not\ncontraindicate their continued use. Except in large doses,\nsalicylates probably do not depress the heart. In pericarditis it is\nperhaps well always to administer an alkali in some form unless\notherwise contraindicated, whether or not the cause is rheumatism. A\ndiminished alkalinity of the blood would always increase the\nlikelihood of an augmented amount of pericardial or endocardial\ninflammation. The blood must be kept strongly alkaline. It is\npossible that one of the reasons why pericarditis or endocarditis\noccurs so frequently in serious prolonged fevers is that the patient\nhas not eaten enough cereals or other carbohydrates, and the system\nhas become more or less endangered by acidosis. Carbohydrate\nstarvation is inexcusable with our present understanding of the\ndanger from acideinia, and even from a diminished amount of alkalies\nin the blood.\n\nThe cause of pericarditis being so varied, any anti-toxin treatment\nor any vaccine treatment could be indicated only if the cause of the\ninflammation rendered the serum or vaccine advisable.\n\n2. Stopping the Pain.--Nowhere else in the body should pain be so\nspeedily combated as when it occurs in the region of the heart.\nMorphin, with or without atropin, as deemed best, should be\nadministered hypodermically in the amount and with the frequency\nnecessary to stop the pain and quiet the restlessness. As stated\nabove, the frequent need for morphin may be prevented by use of the\nice bag. Morphin might even be considered an abortive treatment, as\nnothing tends so much to inhibit this inflammation as the quietude\nof the heart caused by the absence of pain, the production of sleep\nand the prevention of restlessness, muscle twitching and muscle\nmovements. The more quiet the patient is, the more quiet is the\nheart.\n\nIf for any reason morphin is contraindicated, and if pain is not a\nsymptom, the patient's nerves may be quieted and rest may be given\nby sodium bromid, or by", "doc_id": "2adbc8ac-11d5-4b2d-ae44-af4ebe30f2d2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "782b74a46eeccde15da4ea9e51923e10df30f613d9a5d834503de9bceb64bf7c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 214039, "end": 217926}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "dee16ba0-484a-4c08-b0c4-7a6b8b874b5b", "3": "d834b221-1179-4a22-83f4-161697873e6b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d834b221-1179-4a22-83f4-161697873e6b": {"__data__": {"text": "with or without atropin, as deemed best, should be\nadministered hypodermically in the amount and with the frequency\nnecessary to stop the pain and quiet the restlessness.

The more quiet the patient is, the more quiet is the\nheart.\n\nIf for any reason morphin is contraindicated, and if pain is not a\nsymptom, the patient's nerves may be quieted and rest may be given\nby sodium bromid, or by veronal-sodium, the dose of the former being\n2 gm. (30 grains) two or three times in twenty-four hours, according\nto its action and the necessity for it, and the dose of the latter\n0.2 gm. (3 grains) once in six hours, if deemed necessary.\n\nEspecially if there are cerebral symptoms, as typically presented in\ncerebrospinal meningitis, and especially if the arterial tension is\nlow, the subcutaneous administration of an aseptic ergot will quiet\nthe central nervous system, increase the blood pressure, quiet the\nheart, and prolong the action of a single dose of morphin. It is the\nbest plan to administer ergot deep into the muscles, with the\ndeltoid as the place of choice. If the skin is properly cleansed,\nthe syringe clean and the preparation of the drug aseptic, no\ninflammation or abscess will ever occur. If there is any painful\nswelling, a wet alcohol dressing to the part will soon relieve it.\nThe frequence with which ergot should be so administered depends on\nthe results and the indications. Once in twelve hours for several\ndoses is generally the best method for its use.\n\n3. The Exudate.--When a fluid exudate into the pericardium has\noccurred from inflammation that is, when it is not an exudate from\ndisturbed kidneys or circulation--it will continue to increase to\nsome extent in spite of any treatment. Just how much this exudate\nmay be prevented by the use of small blisters over or around the\nheart, and just how much watery stools and diuresis may prevent the\nadvance of the exudate is difficult to determine. Small blisters,\nproperly applied, have many times seemed to be the determining\nfactor in stopping the increase in the fluid, or to have been the\nstarting cause of the resorption of the exudate.\n\nThe amount of purging that should be caused by saline cathartics\nsuch as sodium sulphate (Glauber salt), potassium and sodium\ntartrate (Rochelle salt), or the official compound jalap powder\ncannot be declared dogmatically. Saline purging should be governed\nby the character of the circulation. If the heart is strong, the\npulse not weak, and the blood pressure good, nothing is more\nvaluable in this condition. Portal depletion is of great advantage,\nespecially if the amount of liquid ingested is kept as low as\npossible, so that the blood vessels may become thirsty and thus tend\nto absorb an exudate wherever they find it. Much harm has been done,\nhowever, and death has been caused by saline purgatives in\nendeavoring to relieve edemas from a failing heart or to prevent a\nuremia from kidney inflammation. The depression following such\npurging is often serious. If the circulation is weak, dependence\nshould be placed on purgation by some of the simple vegetable\ncathartics or a small dose of calomel. While it is advisable to give\na saline in concentrated solution, it should not be so strong as to\ncause vomiting. With our better understanding of magnesium\nabsorption and the depressant effect of magnesium on the nervous\nsystem, magnesium salts should not be used in serious", "doc_id": "d834b221-1179-4a22-83f4-161697873e6b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "278f9a0333c102338e3978d8cda7399b8b0987b793815c958446f0e028285893", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 217946, "end": 221700}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "2adbc8ac-11d5-4b2d-ae44-af4ebe30f2d2", "3": "031e0955-f23f-441a-b850-5bc992b36584"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "031e0955-f23f-441a-b850-5bc992b36584": {"__data__": {"text": "vessels may become thirsty and thus tend\nto absorb an exudate wherever they find it.

With our better understanding of magnesium\nabsorption and the depressant effect of magnesium on the nervous\nsystem, magnesium salts should not be used in serious conditions.\n\nDiuretics often do not act well when most needed. The simplest\ndiuretic is potassium citrate, given in wintergreen or peppermint\nwater, in doses of 2 gm. (30 grains), three or four tunes in twenty-\nfour hours. One or more of the vegetable, nonirritant diuretics may\nbe tried if preferred. If the sickness preceding the pericarditis\nwas not a long fever, and the heart muscle is considered in good\ncondition, digitalis in small doses may be the best possible\ndiuretic. Incidentally it will slow the heart, if there is not much\nelevation of temperature, and will give some cardiac rest.\n\nAlthough the patient's diet should be limited in bulk, and\nespecially in amount of liquids, good nutrition should soon be\ngiven. Systemic weakness certainly tends to increase the exudate;\nsystemic strength aids in absorption of the exudate.\n\nIron is early indicated, and nothing is better than 5 drops of the\ntincture of chlorid of iron in a little lemonade or orangeade,\nadministered once in eight hours.\n\nIf the exudate tends to decrease, it perhaps may be hastened by the\nlocal application of tincture of iodin over the cardiac region. Also\nthe administration of small doses of an iodid, as 0.3 gm. (5 grains)\nof sodium iodid, given in plenty of water three times a day, is\nuseful. An iodid circulating in the blood seems to aid absorption.\nIt has long been believed that iodin in the blood tends to promote\nabsorption of thickened, left-over material from exudates, and to\nprevent the formation of strong fibrous adhesions. Until our\nknowledge is more exact in this matter, it is advisable to use iodid\nas suggested. If the above-named dose is not tolerated, less should\nbe given.\n\nIf in spite of all the therapeutic measures suggested, the fluid\nincreases and the pericardium becomes more distended and the heart's\naction more labored, paracentesis must be done. The point at which\nthe aspirating needle should be inserted into the pericardium\ndepends somewhat on the conditions in each individual case. It is\noften best to insert an exploratory needle first. This will\ndetermine the fluidity and character of the exudate. If pus is\nfound, a more radical surgical procedure than simple paracentesis\nmust be done immediately. The point of puncture for aspiration most\nfrequently chosen is in the fourth or fifth intercostal space, about\nan inch to the left of the sternal margin. Paracentesis is also\noften done in the region of the normal apex beat. The position of\nthe patient is determined by his dyspnea; he should lie in the\nposition most comfortable for him. The fluid should be withdrawn\nslowly and the pulse carefully watched. The withdrawal of a small\namount of fluid may later seem to be the starting cause of\nresorption of the rest of the fluid. On the other hand, it may often\nbe not of more value than the simple removal of the immediate\npressure, the fluid may again accumulate, and more radical surgery\nmust be performed.\n\n4.

The fluid should be withdrawn\nslowly and the pulse carefully watched. The withdrawal of a small\namount of fluid may later seem to be the starting cause of\nresorption of the rest of the fluid. On the other hand, it may often\nbe not of more value than the simple removal of the immediate\npressure, the fluid may again accumulate, and more radical surgery\nmust be performed.\n\n4. To Strengthen the Heart.--Most of the methods of meeting this\nindication have already been stated, namely, absolute rest; absolute\nquiet; the use of the bed pan; any movement that must be made should\nbe deliberate; the nurse and other attendants must be quiet;\nnecessary conversation must be brief, and every method must be used\nto quiet and prevent the heart's action from becoming rapid. The\nfood taken should be small in amount and nonstimulating; that is, no\ntea or coffee should be given, and nothing too hot or too cold.\nMovements of the bowels should be caused with the least possible\ngeneral disturbance. If the patient does not sleep, he must be made\nto sleep. The whole body and the nervous system must have periods of\nrest. If the heart is very weak, small closes of morphin may be\nused. If the heart is not weak, bromids or chloral may be given. If\nthe blood pressure is high, such hypnotics will lower it, or if the\nheart is strong and the condition does not contraindicate it,\naconite may be used in small doses, for a day or two, unless the\nfever is high and it seems advisable to use one of the coal-tar\nantipyretics, which reduce the blood tension and the heart activity.\n\nAs stated above, pain must not be allowed. Sometimes, when the heart\nhas not been injured by prolonged fever, digitalis in small doses\nmay slow the heart and act for good.\n\nConvalescence.--The convalescence should be prolonged as in any\nother cardiac inflammation. The patient should be given more and\nmore nourishing food, and the iron tonic may be changed to a capsule\ncontaining 0.05 gm. of quinin and 0.05 gm. of reduced iron, three\ntimes a day.\n\nIt is a question as to when patients convalescent from pericarditis\nshould be permitted exercise. It has been thought that gentle\nmovements and possibly exercise, sooner than theoretically\njustified, might cause the heart to beat a little more actively and\npossibly prevent the formation of tight adhesions between the two\nlayers of the pericardium. Whether such activity of the heart will\nprevent adhesions is something that has not been determined.\n\nThe small doses of sodium iodid, perhaps 0.2 gm. (3 grains) two or\nthree times a day, should be continued for some time. Iodid in this\ndosage does no harm and may do a great deal of good.\n\n\nADHERENT PERICARDITIS\n\nFollowing dry pericarditis or pericarditis with an exudate,\nespecially when the exudate is fibrinous in character, the fibrous\nsubstance which is not absorbed or resorbed may develop into\nconnective tissue, and the two pericardial surfaces become\npermanently grown together, causing the so-called adherent\npericarditis. These adhesions between the two surfaces of the\npericardium may be general throughout the entire pericardial sac, or\nthey may be limited to some one or more parts of the pericardium.\nPerhaps one of the most frequent points of adhesion is the anterior\npart of the pericardium, while the apex is the part most likely to\nbe free, even when other parts of the pericardium have grown\ntogether.

This freedom of the apex is probably due to the constant\nand more extensive motion of the apical portion of the heart, and is\nthe reason that it has been suggested, as referred to under acute\npericarditis, that, other conditions not contraindicating, the\npatient may be allowed to move about a little during convalescence\nto cause the heart to beat more actively. Sometimes the surfaces of\nthe pericardium are not closely adherent to each other, but bands of\nadhesion stretch from one surface to the other.\n\nAfter adhesions have taken place between the two layers of the\npericardium, the action of the heart is impaired, serious\ninterference with the cardiac action may develop, and sudden death\nmay occur. If the heart is given all the rest possible during the\nacute phase of the disease, there will be less likelihood of the\nsurfaces becoming so irritated that adhesions readily form. Anything\nwhich permits complete absorption and resorption of tile exudate\nwill tend to prevent these hampering adhesions. If the adhesions are\nsuch as to cause irregular heart, recurrent pain and the danger of\nsudden death, surgical help has been suggested. This surgical\nprocedure is to remove a portion of the ribs, perhaps of the third,\nfourth and fifth, to allow the heart more freedom of action to\ncompensate for the impairment of its activity from the adhesions.\nSuch an operation was first suggested by Brauer of Heidelberg in\n1902.\n\nThe question of the best method of producing anesthesia in this\ncondition of the heart is a serious one. A patient might die during\nthe anesthesia; but he might also die at any time from cardiac\nspasm. In certain instances, in adults, local anesthesia might be\nsufficient. Pain reflexes, however, would be serious. Such an\noperation would be indicated when the apex is fixed so that there is\na constant sensation of hugging of the heart at the fourth and fifth\nribs, with paroxysms of pain and cardiac weakness.\n\n\n\n\nMYOCARDIAL DISTURBANCES\n\n\nWhile the myocardium is the most important muscle structure of the\nbody, it has but recently been studied carefully or well understood\nclinically or pathologically. A heart was \"hypertrophied\" or\n\"dilated\" or perhaps \"fatty.\" It suffered from \"pain,\" \"angina\npectoris,\" from some \"serious weakness\" or from \"coronary disease,\"\nand that ended the pathology and the clinical diagnosis. This is the\nage of heart defects; no one can understand a patient's condition\nnow, whatever ails him, without studying his heart. No one can treat\na patient properly now without considering the management of the\ncirculation. No one should administer a drug now without considering\nwhat it will do to the patient's heart.\n\nAlthough we are scientifically interested in the administration of\nspecific treatments, antitoxins and vaccines; although we have a\nbetter understanding of food values, and order diets with more\ncareful consideration of the exact needs of the individual, and\nalthough we are using various physical methods to promote\nelimination of toxins, poisons and products of metabolism, we have\nuntil lately forgotten the physical fact that one thirteenth of the\nweight of a normal adult is blood.

A man who weighs 170 pounds has\n13 pounds of blood. This proportion is not true in the obese, and is\nnot true in children. Whether the person is sick in bed, miserable\nthough up and about, or beginning to feel the first sensations of\nslight incapacity for his life work, his ability properly to\ncirculate this one thirteenth of his weight through the various\narterial and venous channels and capillary tracts must, with the\nincreasing tension and speed of our lives, be taken into\nconsideration.\n\nThe more and more frequently repeated statements that the operation\nwas successfully performed but that the patient died of shock, and\nthat the typhoid fever and the pneumonia were being successfully\ncombated, but that the patient died of heart failure, together with\nthe increase in arteriosclerosis, cardiac disturbances and renal\ndisease, emphatically present the necessity of more carefully\nstudying the circulation. A better understanding and the constant\nstudy of the blood pressure shows nothing but the necessity of the\nage. The unwillingness of the patient to suffer pain, even for a few\nminutes, without some narcotic, generally a cardiac debilitating\ndrug, means that, if he is a sufferer from chronic or recurrent\npain, he has taken a great deal of medicine which has done his heart\nno good. Repeated high tension of life raises the blood pressure and\nputs more work on the heart. Therefore the heart is found weary, if\nnot actually degenerated, when any serious accident, medical or\nsurgical, happens to the patient.\n\nThe requirements of the age have, then, necessitated that the heart\nbe more carefully studied, and therefore the heart strength and its\ndisturbances are better understood. The mere determination as to\nwhere the apex beat is located, and as to what murmurs may be\npresent is not sufficient; we must attempt to determine the probable\ncondition of the myocardium. The following conditions are\nrecognized: (1) acute myocarditis, (2) chronic myocarditis\n(fibrosis, cardiosclerosis), (3) fatty degeneration, and (4) fatty\nheart.\n\n\nACUTE MYOCARDITIS\n\nProbably most acute infections cause more or less myocarditis,\ndepending on their intensity and their prolongation. This\ndisturbance of the heart is often unrecognized, and has been simply\nreferred to as \"the heart growing weaker from the fever process.\"\nThe acute infections most likely to cause a myocarditis are\nrheumatism, influenza, sepsis, cerebrospinal meningitis, diphtheria,\ntyphoid fever, scarlet fever, and mouth and throat infections. It is\nprobably rare when acute endocarditis occurs that more or less\nmyocarditis is not present. The acute myocarditis may develop some\nfatty degeneration, and with this softening and weakening of the\nheart muscle acute dilatation readily occurs, which may be a cause\nof sudden death, or, if less serious, may be the cause of prolonged\ndisability, if the heart ever recovers its original size and\nstrength.\n\nThe symptoms are often indefinite, and the diagnosis of the\ncondition hardly possible.

It may be taken for granted, however,\nthat hardly any serious illness can long continue without cardiac\nmuscle disturbance. If endocarditis is present, soft systolic\nmurmurs soon appear. With the acute myocarditis developing, the apex\nbeat is less positive, less accentuated, and later it becomes\ndiffuse and even feeble. The closure of the aortic valve is less\ntypically sharp, showing that the blood vessels are not so\nthoroughly filled. The peripheral circulation is not so active, the\nblood pressure falls, and the heart becomes more rapid, especially\non the least exertion. All of these signs indicate myocardial\nweakness.\n\nThe treatment of this condition is largely preventive. It should be\nwell recognized that prolonged high fever, prolonged insufficient or\nimproper nutrition, prolonged acute pain, and especially prolonged\nseptic processes will always cause myocardial degeneration. It\nshould be recognized that after ether and chloroform anesthesia,\nespecially after chloroform, the heart muscle may be disturbed and\nthe tonicity be lost. Therefore after anesthesia, after operations,\nand after all illnesses which have lasted more than a few days, the\nconvalescence of the patient must be more or less deliberate. Sudden\nrising, sudden erect posture, the exertion of walking too early,\ngoing up stairs too early or taking moderate, and later severe\nexercise too early, may cause dilatation of the heart muscle that\nhas become weakened by acute myocarditis. If acute myocarditis is\nbelieved or known to be present, cardiac tonics such as digitalis\nshould not be given; large doses of strychnin should not be given;\nvasocontractors such as ergot should not be given; large amounts of\nfood or large bulks of liquid should not be taken into the stomach\nat one time; in fact, unless there is some special indication, the\ntwenty-four hour amount of fluid should be diminished. The surface\ncirculation and the muscle circulation should be improved by such\ncold or warm water applications as the disease or condition calls\nfor. Massage should be early inaugurated to promote the return\ncirculation. The heart should be treated as though it were the\nfrailest of Venetian glass and would crack with the least rough\nhandling, or even with a rapid change of temperature, great cold or\ntoo much heat. A prolonged, tedious convalescence, with the return\nto activity so graded as to give the heart no strain, and to keep\nits work always just below what it is able to do, will often mean\nreturn to perfect strength and health.\n\nNo cardiac debilitating drug should be administered when myocarditis\nhas been surmised or diagnosed. The safest hypnotic, if one is\nneeded, is morphin in small doses. If there are weakening\nperspirations, atropin should be given, especially as it is also a\ncirculatory stimulant.

Perhaps generally the term \"chronic myocarditis\" is\nincorrect, as a real inflammatory condition is not present and has\nnot been present; it is really a degenerative process with the\ndevelopment of connective tissue, a fibrosis and more or less\nhardening of the arterioles, a cardiosclerosis. In many instances\nthis fibrosis is associated with fat deposits or fatty degeneration.\nThe disease is often caused by a narrowing or obstruction or\ncalcareous degeneration of the coronary arteries, thus diminishing\nthe blood supply to the heart muscle. This chronic myocardial\ndegeneration is often a part of the general arteriosclerosis, and is\nan important factor in what is termed cardiovascular-renal disease.\nIn simple chronic renal diseases the heart first normally\nhypertrophies to overcome the increased blood tension and increased\nresistance.\n\nThe principal causes of this degeneration are normal old age, or\npremature age caused by various conditions. In other words, anything\nwhich hastens arteriosclerosis will cause myocardial degeneration.\nThe causes recognized as most frequently producing this condition\nare syphilis; gout; repeated attacks of rheumatism; excess in the\nuse of alcohol (meaning repeated daily too large amounts, as well as\nactual dipsomania); the overuse of tobacco; excess in drinking tea\nor coffee; general overeating, and excessive eating of meat in\nparticular, if the organs of elimination do not work perfectly and\nif such eating causes or allows putrefactive changes in the\nintestines; and progressive, prolonged wasting diseases, such as\ntuberculosis and cancer. It has also seemed in some cases that the\nonly cause was excessive, hard physical labor, including excessive\nathletic work, and in other cases that prolonged anxiety and worry\nhave been causes of cardiac degeneration and actual cardiac failure.\nProlonged absorption of toxins from mouth and tonsil infections may\nbe a not infrequent cause.\n\nThese myocardial changes are sometimes associated with chronic\npericarditis and chronic endocarditis, and may accompany or follow\nvalvular disease of the heart.

Failure of compensation in valvular\ndisease and dilatation of the heart are sequences which occur sooner\nor later.\n\n\nSYMPTOMS AND SIGNS\n\nThe symptoms of chronic myocardial degeneration are progressive\nweakness, slight at first, noticeable on exertion (and what was not\nconsidered exertion becomes such), as evidenced by slight\npalpitation, slight shortness of breath, leg weariness and mental\ntire. The heart frequently becomes more rapid, not only with\nexertion and change of position to the erect, but even after eating.\nSlight cardiac stimulants, as coffee, affect the heart more than\npreviously; there is some sleeplessness, more or less troublesome,\nand more or less indigestion. There may be mental irritability and\nsome mental deterioration, as shown in various ways. There are\nlikely to be slight edemas of the lower extremities toward night.\nThe amount of urine may diminish. A previously high blood pressure\nbecomes lower. The pulse may be occasionally intermittent, and later\nactually irregular.\n\nThe physical signs often show an enlargement of the heart, with\nincreased activity at first, from irritability of the heart and a\nlack of perfect coordination; later the heart may show typical signs\nof weakness. Not infrequently a heart suffering from fibrosis acts\nperfectly until some sudden exertion, as lifting, running or serious\nillness causes it suddenly to become weak. Such a heart rarely\nregains its former strength. This occurs frequently to those who\nhave supposed themselves to be in perfect physical health. Some\nsudden strain which they have previously been able to endure without\ninjury, such as carrying a weight upstairs, cranking a refractory\nengine, pumping up a series of tires, or walking rapidly with a\nyounger or more active companion, will suddenly give cardiac\ndistress signals, serious exhaustion and more or less lengthy\nprostration, perhaps for an hour or so, or perhaps for several days.\nPermanent cardiac weakness may follow, or compensation may again\noccur, to be more easily broken later. Slight cardiac pains and\nsensations referred to the cardiac region become frequent. Disliking\nto lie on the left side, when previously the patient has been able\nto sleep on this side without discomfort, is an evidence of cardiac\ndisturbance. There may be no real pains, but the patient becomes\nconscious of his heart, perhaps for the first time in his life. This\nalone is an indication of coming trouble.\n\nIf these signs and symptoms develop late in life, or at any age with\nother symptoms of sclerosis or senility, little can be done\ntherapeutically except to afford temporary relief and to prevent the\noccurrence of acute attacks of cardiac distress or dyspnea. If the\ndisturbance is really due to chronic cardiac degeneration, the\nsooner the patient learns that his ability is restricted, that his\nlife is narrowed, the better for his future.\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nThe advice he should receive is well understood: to avoid physical\nefforts; to avoid mental tire; to avoid overeating or overdrinking\nof any foods or liquids; to reduce or abstain from alcohol, coffee,\ntea and tobacco, depending on what seems advisable in the individual\ncase; to reduce the amount of meat eaten, especially if there is\nintestinal indigestion; to relieve intestinal indigestion; to cause\nfree daily", "doc_id": "62463466-cd48-4591-9fc8-2218b2d88aad", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "aa1d5064d6120570c4e08384c4001e9a49ba20eb4eb29ea095b1428f9263a011", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 244608, "end": 248447}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "51312fc3-0d10-4554-948a-30e8c0c76308", "3": "84d79e48-06b3-4fe0-9d4f-fc878de9fe57"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "84d79e48-06b3-4fe0-9d4f-fc878de9fe57": {"__data__": {"text": "except to afford temporary relief and to prevent the\noccurrence of acute attacks of cardiac distress or dyspnea.

If the patient cannot take exercise, simple calisthenics\nor massage should be instituted.\n\nWhether nitroglycerin or other nitrite is advisable depends on the\nperipheral blood pressure. If the blood pressure is low, or not\nhigher than is best for the patient, such treatment would be\ninadvisable. If, from the supposed cause, iodid seems to be\nindicated, it should be given in small doses and continued for some\ntime. It is often wise, however, to give small doses, as 0.10 or\n0.20 gm. (2 or 3 grains) once or twice in twenty-four hours, for a\nlong period, to any patient who leas fibrosis or selerosis in any\nform. Iodid tends to prevent the progress of connective tissue\nformation. It is quite possible that some of its value is in\nactivating a sluggish or imperfectly acting thyroid gland. If the\npatient is old, his thyroid is subinvoluting, and a little more of\nits activity will be of advantage. Many diseases which cause chronic\nmyocarditis also cause, later, subactivity of the thyroid. Thyroid\nextract may be indicated if the patient is obese.\n\nIf, in spite of this management and treatment, the patient has\ncardiac asthma attacks, with or without pain, especially if there\nare pendent edemas, the question arises as to whether or not\ndigitalis should be given. In such cases one cannot tell without\ntrying whether digitalis will be of benefit or will cause more\ndiscomfort. 11 small dose of an active preparation should be given\nat first twice in twenty-four hours, and after a week once in\ntwenty-four hours, its action being carefully watched and the\ndecision as to whether the dose is too large or too small arrived\nat. It may do a great amount of good; it can cause increased cardiac\npains. If used carefully and stopped when it appears not to be\nacting well, it will do no harm.\n\nChilling of the surface of the body should be avoided; sudden cold\nor sustained severe cold, which increases the contraction of the\nperipheral blood vessels and puts more strain on the heart muscle,\nis to be avoided if possible. More hours in bed at night and lying\ndown after the heavier meals of the day will tend to give the heart\nthe kind of rest it needs. Also complete rest for one day a week, or\na rest of several days at a time, and a rest, both mental and\nphysical, with such walking, golfing or riding as seems advisable,\nfor at least one month every year, will prolong the lives of these\npatients, and may make an imperfect heart act well for months and\nyears.

If there is fatty degeneration,\nthe prognosis is bad. If there is no serious fatty degeneration, the\npatient, with the modified life outlined, may live for a long time.\nAcute dilatation from any serious strain on the heart may occur, and\nif there is fatty degeneration it is liable to occur at any time.\nAttacks of cardiac asthma are always serious, and always damage the\nheart a little more.\n\n\nFATTY DEGENERATION\n\nFatty degeneration of the heart muscle may be caused by acute\npoisoning (as phosphorus, arsenic, etc.), by serious infections, or\nit may follow fibrosis of the heart or coronary artery disease. The\nsymptoms are those of serious circulatory weaicnens, which does not\nseem to improve under any ordinary management. It is difficult, if\nthe heart is enlarged, to determine whether there is more or less\nserious acute dilatation or whether the heart muscle has suffered\nfatty degenration.\n\nThe treatment of such a patient requires the best of judgment as to\nthe amount of food and liquid that should be given, the regulation\nof the administration of laxatives, the sponging of the body, the\nmeans of producing sleep if there is insomnia, how much reading,\nconversation or amusements should be allowed, how much stimulation\nby stryclmin or other stimulating drug should be given, and whether\nor not very small doses of digitalis should he tried. These are all\nmatters for individualizing, and for the best medical judgment which\nwe are called on to give.

These patients\nare likely to be obese, or at least to have large abdomens with\nlarge deposits of fat around the abdomen. This fat in itself will\ninterfere somewhat with abdominal respiration. This tends to cause\ndyspnea, and the heart tends to be disturbed from these causes, if\nmuch fat is not really in the pericardium. The symptoms are those of\nimperfect heart action; the patient is dyspneic on exertion or in\nleaning over, the heart acts rapidly on such exertion, the patient\npuffs, perspires easily, and becomes leg weary, sedentary in his\nhabits, and more or less incapacitated for work.

Anything which reduces the general weight will help the\nheart. The prognosis is often good.\n\n\n\n\nENDOCARDITIS\n\n\nIt should be understood that especially in acute conditions a\npositive separation of endocarditis from myocarditis is incorrect.\nAcute endocarditis can probably not occur without some inyocarditis,\nand myocarditis probably does not occur without some endocardial\ndisturbance and perhaps some pericardial irritation. This is\nespecially true in endocarditis which occurs during any acute\ninfection, even in rheumatism. The greater the amount of\npericarditis, the more serious is the acute condition. The greater\nthe amount of myocarditis, the more doubtful is the heart strength\nin the near future. The greater the amount of endocarditis, the\ngreater the doubt of freedom from future permanent valvular lesions.\n\nEndocarditis may be divided into: acute mild (simple) endocarditis,\nacute malignant (ulcerative, infective) endocarditis, chronic\nendocarditis and valvular disease.\n\n\nACUTE MILD ENDOCARDITIS\n\nThis inflammation of the endocardium is generally confined to the\nregion of the valves, and the valves most frequently so inflamed are\nthe mitral and aortic. There may be a slight inflammation or actual\nulceration and loss of tissue. Vegetations more or less constantly\noccur on the inflamed surfaces, with more or less danger of\nparticles becoming loosened and moving free in the blood stream,\ncausing embolic obstruction in different parts of the body. There is\nalso more or less probability of serious adhesions or contractions\noccurring from the healing of the ulcerated surfaces. The future\nhealth and welfare of the valves depend on the fact that the\ninflammation has healed without contractions or adhesions.\n\nIt is often difficult to decide when acute endocarditis has\ndeveloped; but with the knowledge that the endocardium often becomes\ninflamed during almost any of the acute infections, the physician\nshould repeatedly examine the heart for murmurs, for muffled closure\nof the valves, or for other evidences of endocarditis or myocarditis\nduring the acute infective process.\n\nIt has been shown positively that acute endocarditis is due to\nmicro-organisms, generally streptococci, staphylococci or\npneumococci, and, more frequently than once believed, gonococci. The\nmost frequent causes are acute rheumatic fever, diphtheria,\npneumonia, cerebrospinal meningitis, scarlet fever, erysipelas,\ninfluenza, chorea, gonorrhea, sepsis and typhoid fever. It may also\nfollow a follicular tonsillitis or some infection of the mouth or\nthroat with or without arthritis. Tuberculosis may also occasionally\ncause an endocarditis. Organisms may be found in a terminal simple\nendocarditis due to a chronic disease, as tuberculosis or cancer;\nsuch inflammations may have been caused by circulating toxins.\n\nIt will be noticed by the foregoing classification that the terms\n\"mild\" and \"malignant\"", "doc_id": "41e8970c-29c2-40ee-a729-412dfa56ea28", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6d96aee84c6bab4c07b86d81855390e57d33d42495dfcad7a72e0b8fb6ca727a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 255876, "end": 259587}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "24c3305a-3804-4b9e-abf8-c939179b96fa", "3": "83714dfb-6885-4ef8-a1e5-0bea7a7def02"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "83714dfb-6885-4ef8-a1e5-0bea7a7def02": {"__data__": {"text": "and, more frequently than once believed, gonococci.

Organisms may be found in a terminal simple\nendocarditis due to a chronic disease, as tuberculosis or cancer;\nsuch inflammations may have been caused by circulating toxins.\n\nIt will be noticed by the foregoing classification that the terms\n\"mild\" and \"malignant\" endocarditis are used. The purpose is to\nconvey the fact that there may be no etiologic distinction between\nthe two forms, and it is impossible to decide clinically in the\nbeginning of an endocardial inflammation which form is present. In\nthe malignant form the infection is probably more serious or the\ninfective germs are more active, the ulcerations deeper, and the\nlikelihood of emboli and the seriousness of such embolic infarcts\nmore serious and more dangerous. The differences in inflammation in\nthe two cases is really one of degree, and the classification is\nmade to coincide with this probable fact. it is, of course,\nclinically recognized that endocarditis following certain diseases,\nespecially rheumatism, is of the simple or mild type, while that\ntermed ulcerative endocarditis may occur apparently as a primary or\ngeneral infection, and the causative bacteria, as a rule, are\nreadily discovered in the blood. The Streptococcus viridans is one\nof the most dangerous of these bacteria.\n\n\nA SECONDARY AFFECTION\n\nMild endocarditis is rarely a primary affection, and is almost\ninvariably secondary to one of the diseases named above. Nearly 75\npercent of secondary endocarditis occurs as a complication of acute\narticular rheumatism and chorea, or subsequently. On the other hand,\nabout 40 percent of all patients with acute articular rheumatism\ndevelop endocarditis, sometimes perhaps so mild as to be hardly\ndiscoverable. This complication is most likely to occur during the\nsecond or third week of rheumatic fever. It is not sufficiently\nrecognized that a subacute arthritis, recurring tonsillitis, open\nand concealed infections in the mouth, and even a condition of the\nsystem with acute, changeable and varying joint and muscle pains may\nall develop a mild endocarditis, even with subsequent valvular\nlesions. Therefore in all of these conditions the decision can be\nmade only as to how much rest the patient must have or how serious\nthe condition is to be considered by careful examination of the\nheart in every instance.\n\nChildren are more liable than adults to this complication,\nespecially with rheumatism. Therefore, acute mild endocarditis with\nfuture valvular lesions occurs most frequently during childhood and\nadolescence, and if one attack has occurred, a subsequent infection,\nespecially of rheumatism, is liable to cause another acute\nendocarditis.\n\n\nPATHOLOGY\n\nThe part of the heart most affected is the part which has the most\nwork to do--the left side of the heart--and of this side the left\nventricle and therefore the mitral and aortic valves; the most\nfrequent valve to be inflamed and to stiffer permanent disability is\nthe a mitral valve, the valve which in its inflamed condition is\nsubjected to the greatest amount of pressure and therefore\nirritation. Not infrequently soft systolic murmurs are heard at the\npulmonary and tricuspid valves during acute endocarditis.

It is\nrare, however, that these valves are so affected during childhood or\nadult life as to be permanently disabled.\n\nWhether a diminished alkalinity of the blood in rheumatism has\nanything to do with the cause of the frequent complication of\nendocarditis has not been determined. Whether the administration of\nalkalies to the point of increasing the alkalinity of the blood is\nany protection against the complication of endocarditis has also not\nbeen positively demonstrated, although clinically such treatment is\nbelieved by a large number of practitioners to be wise.\n\nA chronic endocarditis with permanent lesions of the valves may\nbecome an acute inflammation with an infectious provocation.\n\nIt has been shown that even in a few hours after endocarditis has\nstarted, little vegetations composed of fibrin, with white blood\ncells, red blood pigment and platelets, may develop. Practically in\nall instances such vegetations develop, and later become more or\nless organized into connective tissue. These little vegetations,\ngenerally minute, perhaps not exceeding 4 mm. in height, are\nirregular in contour like a wart. Some of these may have small\npedicles, and as such, of course, are more likely to become loosened\nand fly off into the blood stream. It is of interest to note that\nthese little vegetations are more likely to be on the left side of\nthe heart than the right; on the valves than any other part, and on\nthe mitral valve than on the aortic. The consequence is a more\nfrequent permanent disability of the valves of the left side of the\nheart, and of these more frequently the mitral. Although these\nlittle vegetations and excrescences sooner or later become mostly\nconnective tissue, still fibrin and white blood cells may form thin\nlayers over them, more or less permanent. In this fibrin are\nfrequently found bacteria, even when there has been no recent acute\ninflammation. The deeper layers of the endocardium during acute\ninflammation may become infiltrated with young cells, with resultant\nsoftening and destruction of the intercellular substance. This\nsoftening and some swelling of the lower layers of the endocardium\nallow the pushing up of these extravasated blood cells which, being\ncovered with fibrin, makes the little vegetations above described;\nand as just stated, the fibrin may form a more or less permanent\ncap. If this cap is disintegrated or lost and the cells under it\nwashed away in the blood stream, ulceration takes place, which may\nbe more or less serious, even to the perforation of a valve or\nactual erosion of one of its cusps, and the parts of the valves most\nseriously affected are the parts which strike against each other on\nclosure; as previously stated, the parts subjected to the greatest\nstrain and the greatest amount of friction during the inflammation\nare the parts most seriously affected afterward.\n\nIf a perforation has occurred, it may make a permanent leak. If an\nerosion of the edge of the valve has occurred, it may make permanent\ninsufficient closure. If the valve has become thickened and\nstiffened during the cicatricial healing, it may not only be\nincompetent, but may not open perfectly, and a narrowed orifice may\nbe the consequence.

The occurrence of simple endocarditis is\nundoubtedly frequent during acute disease, and is unrecognized\nbecause there are no lesions of the heart at the time or\nsubsequently; but valvular lesions only too frequently follow the\nendocarditis which occurs with rheumatism. Occasionally the\nulcerations become serious, and ulcerative endocarditis or malignant\nendocarditis develops on the mild inflammation. In this form the\nlittle vegetations are liable to become loosened, fly off into the\nblood stream, and cause emboli in different parts of the body.\n\nRecently Fraenkel [Footnote: Fraenkel: Beitr. z. path. Anat. u. z.\nallg. Path., 1912, iii, 597.] concluded that the microscopic nodules\nwhich occur in endocarditis in the myocardium, and which consist of\nthe several varieties of white blood corpuscles first referred to by\nAschoff in 1904, are characteristic only of acute rheumatism.\nFraenkel found these nodules in the myocardium in a case of chorea,\nshowing the close relationship between it and rheumatism.\n\nWhile repeated careful examination of the heart during acute\ninfections will generally show signs of endocarditis if it is\npresent, even if there are no subjective symptoms, the disease may\nbe so insidious as not to be noted until a valvular lesion occurs.\nOften, however, during the course of the disease, especially in\nrheumatism, there is a slight increase in fever and there is a\ndiscomfort complained of in the region of the heart, frequently\naccompanied by slight dyspnea. Real pain is seldom present unless\nthe pericardium is affected. If the myocardium is much inflamed at\nthe same time, the heart becomes more rapid and the blood tension\nlowered, and the apex beat diminished in intensity and perhaps not\npalpable. If there is pain, with or without pericarditis, it is\noften referred to the epigastrium, especially in children. The\npatient is often nervous, restless and sleepless. In simple\nendocarditis emboli rarely occur. If they do, of course the signs\nwill be in the part in which the infarct occurs. Besides the\ndiminished intensity of the apex beat and its greater diffusion, the\nvalve sounds may be muffled, and sooner or later there may be\nsystolic murmurs over the different orifices. Of course systolic\nmurmurs may be due to a disturbed condition of the blood, but if\nthey occur with the above-mentioned symptoms and signs, endocarditis\nshould be diagnosed. If the heart becomes seriously weak and the\npatient suffers much dyspnea, myocarditis should be known to be\npresent with the endocarditis.

A\ncomplication which is so frequent should always be expected, and\nconsequently warded off or prevented, if possible. Knowledge of the\ndiseases which are most liable to cause endocarditis makes frequent\nheart examinations a necessity, to note when it arrives. While an\nextra heart tire, sleeplessness, and the circulation of unnecessary\ntoxins from a bad condition of the bowels and from improperly\nselected food all make this complication more liable, its occurrence\nis, nevertheless, often unpreventable.\n\nThe most efficacious preventive pleasures are sleep, rest, the\nstopping of pain, prevention of exertion, proper food which does not\ncause flatulence or other indigestion, good, sufficient daily\nmovements of the bowels, the prevention of intestinal distention,\nand maintenance of a clean, moist surface of the body, produced by\nsuch sponging and bathing as the temperature demands.\n\nThe disease having developed, the indications for treatment are\nreally few; in fact, the treatment is mostly negative. There is\ngenerally but little local pain; the temperature from simple\nendocarditis alone is not high and the acute symptoms tend to abate.\n\nLocal Treatment.--Endocarditis having been diagnosed, especially if\nthere is palpation or pain, an ice bag over the heart is often of\nconsiderable value, but not so efficient as in pericarditis. It\noften tends to quiet the heart, and may be of some value reflexly in\nslowing the inflammation. If it causes restlessness, however, and\ndoes not lessen the pain (which in some instances it may increase),\nit certainly should be stopped. Children, in whom this complication\nso frequently occurs, generally do not bear the ice bag well.\nSometimes it may be advisable to substitute warm applications, and\noften a great deal of comfort is derived from them, the patient soon\ngoing to sleep. One of the greatest values of either cold or hot\napplications is diminution of the discomfort from the cardiac\ndisturbance, and the stopping of any pain which may be present. If\nthey do not do this, there is no object in using either cold or\nheat.\n\nThe discomfort from blisters over the heart during the acute stage\nof endocarditis is greater than any good which they can do. In\nadults a few small blisters may be used intermittently around the\nborders of the heart, after the acute symptoms are over, to act\nreflexly on the heart and possibly aid absorption of inflammatory\nproducts. Sometimes improvement seems to follow such treatment; it\ncertainly can do no harm.\n\nDuring convalescence, the skin over the heart may be painted with\niodin, repeated often enough to cause stimulation without injuring\nthe skin; it seems at times to be of value. Various iodin or iodid\nointments have been used, but they probably have no more value than\nthe administration of small doses of iodid.\n\nSystemic Treatment.--As this complication most frequently occurs\nduring acute rheumatism, the question arises as to the value or\nharmfulness", "doc_id": "769a2d62-5119-4b7e-be51-ceacfab63fbd", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "34e50551822ca49a937051566bc84de4c3aa5b2eed2e20483ff9b85a79a4ea98", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 270986, "end": 274915}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "5fed7397-6a6d-452a-bfe9-709fe2fe4c50", "3": "c4f0b623-ca2f-4156-99c0-b8e8d02bd287"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4f0b623-ca2f-4156-99c0-b8e8d02bd287": {"__data__": {"text": "is greater than any good which they can do.

With our recent\nbetter understanding of the action on the heart of pure salicylates\n(either natural or synthetic saliclic acid, which have been shown to\nact identically, if equally pure), we must believe that in any\nordinary dosage they will injure the heart but rarely. While\nsalicylic acid will not prevent endocarditis, it should he\ncontinued, if it is of benefit with regard to the arthritis. The\nindication for its use depends on its effect on the joints. As it\nacts at times almost as a specific in rheumatism, it would seem that\nit should be of value in the endocarditis caused by rheumatism. On\nthe other hand, the endocarditis occurs during the second or third\nweek of acute rheumatism, after the blood has been thoroughly\nsaturated with salicylic acid. Therefore it certainly does not tend\nto prevent rheumatic endocarditis; hence for this complication alone\nsalicylic acid is not indicated.\n\n\nALKALIES\n\nAnything which tends to increase the acidity of the tissues and to\ndiminish the alkalinity of the blood, whether from starvation or\nouter causes, seems to pro-duce endocardial and myocardial\nirritation, if not actual inflammation. Therefore in a disease like\nrheumatism, which seems to be made worse by anything which increases\nthe acidity, alkalies are obviously indicated, and it is probable\nthat an increased alkalinity of the blood tends to prevent\nendocardial irritation, and may soothe an inflammation already\npresent. Until we have some positive knowledge to the contrary,\nalkalies should be freely administered during endocarditis,\nespecially during rheumatic endocarditis. Potassium citrate in 2 gm.\n(30 grain) closes, in wintergreen water, should be given every three\nto six hours, depending on how readily the urine is made alkaline.\nThis may be given with the salicylic acid treatment, and also when\nthe salicylic acid has been stopped. It may be well, if sodium\nsalicylate is being used, to give also sodium bicarbonate, the\nsodium bicarbonate often preventing irritation of the stomach from\nthe sodium salicylate, the dose being equal parts of the sodium\nsalicylate and the sodium bicarbonate administered in plenty of\nwater. If some other form of salicylic acid is preferred,\nnovaspirin, which is methylene-citryl-salicylic acid and contains 62\npercent of salicylic acid, is perhaps the least irritant to the\nstomach of the salicylic preparations. This drug is decomposed in\nthe intestine into its component parts, salicylic acid and\nmethylene-citric acid. If this drug is combined with sodium\nbicarbonate, the disintegration into its component parts would be\nlikely to occur in the stomach.\n\n\nIRON\n\nIt is essential for the welfare of the patient, especially after a\nlong illness before the complication of endocarditis could occur,\nand in rheumatic fever, in which all meat and meat extractives have\nbeen kept from the diet, that small doses of iron should be\nadministered daily.

Not only the fever process, but also the\nsalicylic acid tends to prevent the healthy normal growth of red\ncorpuscles. and such patients suffering from rheumatism are often\nseriously anemic after the aente inflammation has ceased. The iron\nadministered may be 5 drops of the tincture of the chlorid, in\nlemonade or orangeade, twice in twenty-four hours (and it should be\nremembered that lemon and orange burn to alkalies in the system and\ndo not act as acids); or 0.1 gm. (1 1/2 grains) of reduced iron in\ncapsule twice in twenty-four hours, or a 3 grain tablet of\nsaccharated ferric oxid (Eisenzucker) twice in twenty-four hours.\n\n\nOPIUM\n\nAs so many times repeated, real pain must be stopped, and morphin,\neither by the mouth or hypodermically, should be used to the point\nof stopping such pain. If the patient is a young child, codein\nsulphate or the deodorized tincture of opium may be used in the dose\nfound sufficient, and either one will act satisfactorily. The dose\ngiven should be small but repeated sufficiently often to stop the\npain. The dose necessary for the given individual will soon be\nlearned, and that dose may be repeated at such intervals as the\ncondition may require. Sometimes the hypnotic selected, if one is\nneeded, will be sufficient to quiet the cardiac aches or pains.\n\n\nBROMIDS AND CHLORAL\n\nIf there is much restlessness and the circulation is good, that is,\nif myocarditis is probably not present, the bromids may be of great\nvalue, especially in children. The dose should be sufficient to\nquiet the nervous system. The drug may be discontinued after a few\ndays, if the conditions improve. If the bromid, except in large\ndoses, will not cause sleep, a sufficient dose of chloral should be\ngiven. Chloral is one of the most satisfactorily acting drugs which\nwe have to produce sleep and to cause cardiac rest. While it should\nnot be given if there is real cardiac weakness, the good which it\ndoes is so much greater than the possible bad effect on the heart,\nthat it should not be forgotten for some newer hypnotic. The worst\npart of this drug is its taste, and the best way to administer it is\nto have it in solution in water and the dose given on cracked ice\nwith a little lemon juice to be followed by a good drink of water\nand a piece of orange pulp for the patient to chew. Ordinarily a\nbad-tasting drug such as chloral is well administered in\neffervescing water, but effeverscing waters are generally\ninadvisable when there is any kind of inflammation of the heart, as\nthey are liable to cause distention of the stomach and pressure on\nthe heart. Some physicians prefer chloralamid as a less disagreeable\ndrug and one which acts almost as efficiently as chloral. As the\nclose of this must be larger than the dose of chloral, it is a\nquestion of doubt as to which is the better drug to use. Of the\nnewer hypnotics, veronal=sodium (sodium-diethyl-barbiturate) is\namong the best. It acts quickly, is less depressant and is a safer\nsalt than most of the other newer hypnotics.

The dose of this drug is from 0.2 to 0.3 gm. (3\nto 5 grains).\n\n\nPREVENTION\n\nIf the patient is weak, the circulation depressed, the blood\npressure low, and the heart rapid, the drug advisable to produce\nrest and sleep is almost always morphin or some other form of opium.\nMorphin, with few exceptions, is a cardiac tonic and a cardiac\nstimulant, unless the dose is much too large. As long as the bowels\nare daily moved and the food is not given at the time of the full\naction of the morphin, when digestion might be delayed or interfered\nwith, in most patients the action of this drug during serious\nillness is entirely for good. The greatest mistake in using morphin\nfor the production of sleep, or for physical and mental rest and\ncomfort when there is not severe pain, is in giving too large a\ndose. If pain is not severe, or due to inflammatory distention of\nsome undilatable part, to pressure on some nerve, to distention of\nsome tube by a calculus or to some serious injury to the nerves,\nlarge doses of morphin are not needed. Small doses will act much\nmore efficiently. It is excessively rare that a hypodermic of one-\nfourth grain of morphin sulphate is needed, except for the\nconditions enumerated. It is often a fact that so small a dose as\none-eighth grain of morphin or even one-sixth grain will cause\nsufficient stimulation of a nervous patient, because its primary\nstimulant effect on the spinal cord is greater than its depressant\neffect on the brain, to require another dose (one-fourth grain\naltogether) to give such a patient rest. On the other hand, this\npatient may many times be quieted by one-tenth grain of morphin\nsulphate on account of the size of the dose being not sufficient to\nstimulate the spinal cord. Many a time clinically when one-eighth\ngrain has failed, a dose of one-fourth grain having been apparently\nnecessary, a change to one-tenth grain has proved entirely and\nperfectly satisfactory.\n\n\nDIET\n\nAs intimated in the preceding paragraph, the diet during\nendocarditis must be carefully regulated. It must be sufficient, and\nappropriate for the disease in which the complication occurs, but it\nmust be in such dosage and administered with such frequency as to\ncause the least possible indigestion. Large amounts of milk are\nrarely advisable. Too much milk is certainly given, even in\nrheumatism. While pretty well tolerated by children, it is often\nbadly tolerated as far as digestive symptoms are concerned, by\nadults. The amount of liquid given should be governed by the amount\nof urine passed and by the amount of perspiration. The patient\nshould not be overloaded with liquid if he does not need it.

If the bowels have been neglected, a\nsmall dose of calomel, aided by a compound aloin tablet, is\nnecessary and good treatment. Subsequent movements of the bowels\nshould be daily obtained by vegetable laxatives with occasional\nenemas, as needed. With all inflammation of the heart and the\npossibility of myocarditis developing or being actually present, it\nis not advisable to use salines freely or often.\n\n\nCARDIAC DRUGS\n\nWhether any drug should be used which acts directly on the heart is\noften a question for decision. As endocarditis is generally\nsecondary to some acute disease, the patient has become weakened\nalready, and the circulation is not sturdy; therefore such a drug as\naconite is probably never indicated. The necessary diminished diet,\ncatharsis, hypnotic, salicylic acid and alkalies all tend to quiet\nthe circulation and diminish any strenuosity of the heart that may\nbe present. Unfortunately, during fever processes, digitalis in\nordinary doses rarely slows the heart; and while it might slow the\nheart if given in large doses, it would also cause too powerful\ncontractions of the ventricles. Digitalis is inadvisable if there is\nmuch endocardial inflammation, and especially if there is supposed\nor presumed to be acute myocardial inflammation. If a patient had\nalready valvular disease from a previous endocarditis, and during\nthis attack insufficiency of the heart was evidenced by pendent\nedemas, digitalis Should be administered; but it probably should not\nbe given to other patients during the acute period of inflammation.\n\n\nBATHS\n\nDuring rheumatism the peripheral blood vessels are generally dilated\nand the skin perspires profusely. This is caused not only by the\nrheumatism, but also by the salicylates. The surface of the body\nshould be sponged with cold, lukewarm or hot water, depending on the\ntemperature, especially of the skin. The cold water will reduce the\ntemperature and tone the peripheral blood vessels; the hot water, if\nthe temperature is low and the skin moist and flabby, will cleanse\nit and also tone the peripheral blood vessels. If the blood vessels\nare dilated and the perspiration profuse, atropin is indicated, both\nas a cardiac stimulant and contractor of the blood vessels and as a\npreventer of too profuse sweating. The dose should be from 1/200 to\n1/100 grain for an adult, given two or three times in twenty-four\nhours, depending on its action and the indications. It should be\nremembered that atropin is not a sleep-producer; it may stimulate\nthe cerebrum. Therefore at night it might well be combined with a\npossible necessary hypodermic injection of morphin.\n\n\nSTRYCHNIN\n\nThe question of the advisability of strychnin is a constant subject\nfor discussion. Strychnin is overused in the cases of most patients\nwho are seriously ill. In a patient in whom we are trying to cause\nnervous and muscular rest, strychnin is certainly contraindicated.\nOn the other hand, if the heart is acting sluggishly, the peripheral\ncirculation is imperfect, and atropin is not acting well, it is\nadvisable to give strychnin in a dose not too large and not too\nfrequently repeated.

Whether it should\nbe given by the mouth or hypodermically would depend entirely on the\nseriousness of the condition. Once in six hours is generally often\nenough for strychnin to be administered unless the dose is very\nsmall.\n\n\nALCOHOL\n\nIt is rarely, if ever, advisable to use alcohol. In certain\ninstances, however, especially in older patients who are accustomed\nto alcohol, a little whisky administered several times a day may act\nonly for good, both as a food and as a peripheral dilator. But it\nmust be remembered that alcohol is not a cardiac stimulant, and that\na large dose will be followed by more cardiac depression.\nNitroglycerin may act as well as whisky in the kind of cases\nmentioned. Caffein stimulation in any form is generally inadvisable\nduring inflammation of the heart.\n\n\nPROGNOSIS AND CONVALESCENCE\n\nThe duration of acute endocarditis varies greatly; it may be two or\nthree weeks, or the inflammation may become subacute and last for\nseveral months. Although mild endocarditis rarely causes death of\nitself, it may develop into an ulcerative endocarditis, and then be\nserious per se. On the other hand, it may add its last quota of\ndisability to a patient already seriously ill, and death may occur\nfrom the combination of disturbances. As soon as all acute symptoms\nhave ceased, rheumatic or otherwise, and the temperature is normal,\nthe amount of food should be increased; the strongly acting drugs\nshould be stopped; the alkalies, especially, should not be given too\nlong, and the salicylates should be given only intermittently, if at\nall; iron should be continued, massage should be started, and iodid\nshould be administered, best in the form of the sodium iodid, from\n0.1 to 0.2 gm. (1 1/2 to 3 grains), twice in twenty-four hours, with\nthe belief that it does some good toward promoting the resorption of\nthe endocardial inflammatory products and can never do any harm.\nProlonged bed rest must be continued, visitors must still be\nproscribed, long conversations must not be allowed, and the return\nto active mental and physical life must be most deliberate.\n\nNo clinician could state the extent to which the valvular\ninflammation will improve or how much disability of the valves must\nbe permanent. It is even stated by some clinicians that a rest in\nbed for three months is advisable. While this is of course\nexcessive, certainly, when the future health and ability of the\npatient are under consideration, and especially when the patient is\na child or an adolescent, time is no object compared with the future\nwelfare of the person's heart. It is one of the greatest pleasures\nof a the clinician to note such a previously inflamed heart\ngradually diminish in size and the murmurs at the valves affected\ngradually disappear.

Fresh air and plenty of it, and dry air if possible, is\nwhat is needed in rheumatism, and a shut-up, over-heated and\nespecially a damp room will continue rheumatism indefinitely. It is\nalmost as serious for rheumatism as it is for pneumonia.

The prevention of mouth\ninfections will be the prevention of rheumatism and of endocarditis.\n\n\nMALIGNANT ENDOCARDITIS: ULCERATIVE ENDOCARDITIS\n\nSince we have learned that bacteria are probably at the bottom of\nalmost any endocarditis, the terms suggested under the\nclassification of endocarditis as \"mild\" and \"malignant\" really\nrepresent a better understanding of this disease. They are not\nseparate entities, and a mild endocarditis may become an ulcerative\nendocarditis with malignant symptoms. On the other hand, malignant\nendocarditis may apparently develop de novo. Still, if the cause is\ncarefully sought there will generally be found a source of\ninfection, a septic process somewhere, possibly a gonorrhea, a\nseptic tonsil or even a pyorrhea alveolaris. Septic uterine\ndisturbances have long been known to be a source of this disease.\nMeningitis, pneumonia, diphtheria, typhoid fever and rarely\nrheumatism may all cause this severe form of endocarditis.\n\nUlcerative endocarditis was first described by Kirkes in 1851, was\nlater shown to be a distinctive type of endocarditis by Charcot and\nVirchow, and finally was thoroughly described by Osler in 1885.\n\nUlcerative endocarditis was for a long time believed to be\ninevitably fatal; it is now known that a small proportion of\npatients with this disease recover. Children occasionally suffer\nfrom it, but it is generally a disease of middle adult life. Chorea\nmay bear an apparent causal relation to it in rare instances.\n\nUlcerative endocarditis may develop on a mild endocarditis, with\ndisintegration of tissue and deep points of erosion, and there may\nbe little pockets of pus or little abscesses in the muscle tissue.\nIf such a process advances far, of course the prognosis is\nabsolutely dire. If the ulcerations, though formed, soon begin to\nheal, especially in rheumatism, the prognosis may be good, as far as\nthe immediate future is concerned. If the process becomes septic, or\nif there is a serious septic reason for the endocarditis, the\noutlook is hopeless.

One of the most frequent is the\nStreptococcus viridans.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS\n\nIf a more malignant form of endocarditis develops on a mild\nendocarditis, the diagnosis is generally not difficult. If, without\na definite known septic process, malignant endocarditis develops,\nlocalized symptoms of heart disturbance and cardiac signs may be\nvery indefinite.\n\nIf there is no previous disease with fever, the temperature from\nthis endocarditis is generally intermittent, accompanied by chills,\nwith high rises of temperature, even with a return to normal\ntemperature at times. There may be prostration and profuse sweats.\nEven without emboli there may be meningeal symptoms: headache,\nrestlessness, delirium, dislike of light and noise, and stupor; even\nconvulsions may occur. The urine generally soon shows albumin; there\nmay be joint pains; the spleen is enlarged and the liver congested.\nSome definite cardiac symptoms are soon in evidence, with more or\nless progressive cardiac weakness. Occasionally there are no\nsymptoms other than the cardiac.\n\nCharacteristic of this inflammation is the development of ecchymotic\nspots on the surface of the body, especially on the feet and lower\nextremities. Sooner or later, in most instances of the severe form\nof this disease, emboli from the ulcerations in the heart reach the\ndifferent organs of the body, and of course the symptoms will depend\non the place in which the emboli locate. If in the abdomen, there\nare colicky pains with disturbances, depending on the organs\naffected; if in the brain, there may be paralysis, more or less\ncomplete. In all infaret occurs in one of the organs of the body\nthere must of necessity occur a necrosis of the part and an added\nfocus of infection. If a peripheral artery is plugged, gangrene of\nthe part will generally occur, if the patient lives long enough.\n\n\nTREATMENT\n\nIf pneumonia or gonorrhea is supposed to be the cause of the\nendocarditis, injections of stock vaccines should perhaps be used.\nIf the form of sepsis is not determinable, streptococcic or\nstaphylococcic vaccines might be administered. It is still a\nquestion whether such \"shotgun\" medication with bacteria is\nadvisable. Patients recover at times from almost anything, and the\ninterpretation of the success of such injection treatment is\ndifficult.

This may occur in a previous\nrheumatic heart and in a heart which has suffered endocarditis and\nhas valvular lesions, or it may occur from valvular strain or heart\nstrain from various causes; it is typically a part of the\narteriosclerotic process of age, and is then mostly manifested at\nthe aortic valve.\n\n\nETIOLOGY\n\nRheumatism is the cause of most instances of cardiac disease which\ndate back to childhood or youth, while arteriosclerosis and chronic\ninfection cause most cardiac diseases in the adult. In the former\ncase it is the mitral valve which is the most frequently affected,\nwhile in the latter it is the aortic valve. Any cause which tends to\ninduce arteriosclerosis may be a cause of chronic endocarditis, such\nas gout, syphilis, chronic nephritis, alcoholism, excessive use of\ntobacco, excessive muscular labor and hard athletic work. Lead is\nalso another, now rather infrequent, cause. Severe infections may\ntend to make not only an arteriosclerosis occur early in life, but\nalso a chronic endocarditis. Heart strain may also be a cause of\nchronic endocarditis, especially at the aortic valve. Forced marches\nof soldiers, competitive athletic feats, and occupations which call\nfor repeated hard physical strain may all cause aortic valve\ndisease. Tobacco, besides increasing the blood tension and thus\nperhaps injuring the aortic valve, may weaken the heart muscle and\ncause disturbance and irritation and perhaps inflammation of the\nmitral valve.\n\nThere is no age which is exempt from valvular disease, but the age\ndetermines the valve most liable to be affected. If endocarditis\noccurs in the fetus, it is the right side of the heart that is\naffected; in children and during adolescence it is most frequently\nthe mitral valve that is involved; while in the adult or in old age\nit is the aortic valve that is most liable to become diseased.\nStatistics have shown that the valves of the left side of the heart\nare diseased nearly twenty times as frequently as those of the right\nside of the heart. They also show that the mitral valve is diseased\nmore than one and one-half times as frequently as the aortic valve.\nEarly in life probably the two sexes are equally affected with\nvalvular disease, with perhaps a slight preponderance among females,\nbecause of their greater tendency to chorea.

Aortic disease,\non the other hand, from the very fact of their strenuous life and\noccupations, is nearly three times more frequent in men than in\nwomen.\n\n\nPATHOLOGY\n\nIf a chronic endocarditis has followed an acute condition, some\nslight permanent papillomas or warty growths may he left from the\nhealed granulating or ulcerated surfaces. Sometimes these little\nelevations on the valves become inflamed and then adhere together,\nor adhere to the wall of the heart, and thus incapacitate a valve.\nSometimes these excrescences undergo partial fatty degeneration, or\nmay take on calcareous changes and thus stiffen a valve.\n\nIf the chronic inflammation is not superimposed on an acute\nendocarditis there may be no cell infiltration and therefore no\nsoftening, but there is a tendency to develop a fibrillated\nstructure, and a fibroid thickening of the endocardium occurs,\nespecially around the valves. This induration causes contraction and\nnarrowing of the orifices with shortening and thickening of the\nchordae tendineae, and the valves imperfectly open, or no longer\nclose. Fatty degeneration may occur in the papillary growths with\nnecrotic changes, and this may lead to the formation of atheromatous\nulcers which may later become covered with lime deposits, and then a\nhard calcareous ring may form. Fibrin readily deposits on this\ncalcareous substance and may form a permanent capping, or may slowly\ndisintegrate and allow fragments to fly off into the blood stream\nand cause more or less serious embolic obstruction. If this chronic\nendocarditis develops with a general arteriosclerosis, the wine\ninflammation soon occurs in the aorta, and, following the\nendarteritis in the aorta, atheromatous deposits may also occur\nthere. Chronic endocarditis of the walls of the heart, not in\nimmediate continuity with endocarditis of the valves, is perhaps not\nliable to occur, except with myocarditis.\n\n\nTREATMENT\n\nA subacute or a chronic infective endocarditis should be treated on\nthe same plan as an acute endocarditis, which means rest in bed and\nwhatever medication seems advisable, depending on the supposed cause\nof the condition.\n\nA chronic endocarditis which is part of a general arteriosclerosis\nrequires no special treatment except that directed toward preventing\nthe advance of the general disease.\n\n\n\n\nCHRONIC DISEASES OF THE VALVES\n\nPATHOLOGIC PHYSIOLOGY\n\n\nThe development of permanent injury to one or more valves of the\nheart may have been watched by the physician who cares for a patient\nwith acute endocarditis, or it may have been noted early during the\nprogress of arteriosclerosis or other conditions of hypertension.

The previous history of\nsuch a patient will generally disclose the pathologic cause or the\nphysical excuse.\n\nAs soon as a valve has become injured the heart muscle hypertrophies\nto force the blood through a narrowed orifice or to evacuate the\nblood coming into a compartment of the heart from two directions\ninstead of one, as occurs in regurgitation or insufficiency of a\nvalve. The heart muscle becomes hypertrophied, like any other muscle\nwhich is compelled to do extra work. Which part or parts of the\nheart will become most enlarged depends on the particular valvular\nlesion. In some instances this enlargement is enormous, increasing a\nheart which normally weighs from 10 to 12 ounces to a weight of 20\nor even 25 ounces, and extreme weights of from 40 to 50 ounces and\neven more are recorded.\n\nAs long as the heart remains in this hypertrophied condition, which\nmay be called normal hypertrophy since it is needed for the work\nwhich has to be done in overcoming the defect in the valve, there\nare no symptoms, the pulmonary and systemic circulation is\nsufficient, and the patient does not know that he is incapacitated.\nSooner or later, however, the nutrition of the heart, especially in\natheromatous conditions, becomes impaired, and the lack of a proper\nblood supply to the heart muscle causes myocardial disturbance,\neither a chronic myocarditis or fatty degeneration. If there is no\natheromatous condition of the coronary arteries, and arterial\ndisease is not a cause of the valvular lesion, compensation may be\nbroken by some sudden extra strain put on the heart, either muscular\nor by some acute sickness or a necessary anesthetic and operation.\nFrom any of these causes the muscle again becomes impaired, and the\nheart, especially the part which is the weakest and has the most\nwork to do relatively to its strength, becomes dilated, compensation\nis broken, and all of the various circulatory disturbances resulting\nfrom an insufficient heart strength develop.\n\n\nPRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED\n\nAs long as compensation is complete, there are no medication and\nphysical treatment necessary for the damaged heart. The patient,\nhowever, should be told of his disability, and restrictions in his\nhabits and life should be urged on him. The most important are that\nall strenuous physical exercise should be interdicted; competitive\nathletics should be absolutely prohibited; prolonged muscular effort\nmust never be attempted, whether running, rowing, wrestling, bicycle\nriding, carrying a heavy weight upstairs or overlifting in any form.\nThe patient should be taught that he should never rush upstairs, and\nthat he should never run rapidly for a car or a train or for any\nother reason; he should not pump up a tire, or repeatedly attempt to\ncrank a refractory engine; even the prolonged tension of steering a\ncar for a long distance is inadvisable.

It simply means so much more work for the heart to do.\nSuch patients should rarely be given any drug that causes cardiac\ndebility, and should never take one without advice. This applies to\nall the coal-tar drugs, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), etc.\n\nOne other fact should be impressed on the person with a valvular\nlesion and compensation, and that is that he has but little, if any,\nreserve circulatory power. While he is in apparently perfect health,\nit takes little circulatory strain to push his heart to the point of\ndanger or insufficiency. As nothing keeps this reserve so good or\nincreases it more than rest, he should expect to have a restful day\nat least once a week, and a good rest of at least two or three weeks\nonce or twice a year.\n\nA patient with these restrictions may live for years with a serious\nvalvular defect and may die of some intercurrent disease which has\nnothing to do with the circulatory system.\n\nIt is easily recognizable that as the majority of acute lesions of\nthe valves occur in children, it is impossible to prevent them from\ntaking more or less strenuous exercise, and this is probably the\nreason that we have so many serious broken compensations during\nyouth or early adolescence.\n\nAs referred to under the subject of myocarditis, many symptoms for\nwhich a patient consults his physician are indefinite and\nintangible, though due to cardiac weakness. If a patient with a\ndamaged heart has a sudden dilatation, of course his symptoms are so\nserious that the physician is immediately summoned. If, however, he\nhas a slowly developing insufficiency of the heart muscle, his first\nsymptoms are more or less indefinite cardiac pains, slight shortness\nof breath, slight attacks of palpitation, a dry, tickling, short\ncough occurring after the least exertion, some digestive\ndisturbances, often sluggishness of the bowels, gastric flatulence,\npossibly nosebleeds, and sooner or later some edema of the lower\nextremities at the end of the day.\n\n\nDECOMPENSATION\n\nTo understand the physiology, pathology and the best treatment for\nbroken compensation, it is necessary to study the physics of the\ncirculation under the different conditions. With the mitral valve\ninsufficient, a greater or less amount of blood is regurgitated into\nthe left auricle, which soon becomes dilated.

The muscular tissue of the auricle, however, is not\nsufficient to allow any great hypertrophy. The blood flowing from\nthe pulmonary veins into the left auricle finds this cavity already\npartly filled with blood regurgitated from the left ventricle. The\npulmonary blood, being impeded, tends to flow more slowly, and\ntherefore dams back into the lungs, causing a passive congestion of\nthe lungs. The pulmonary artery thus finds the pressure ahead\nunusually great, and the right ventricle reflexly learns that it\nrequires a greater force to empty itself than before; in fact, it\nmay not succeed in completely accomplishing this until its\ndistention, by an incomplete evacuation of its contained blood plus\nthe blood coming from the right auricle, has caused the right\nventricle also to become hypertrophied. This increased muscular\naction of the right ventricle relieves the pulmonary congestion, and\nan increased amount of blood is forced into the left auricle. On\naccount of its hypertrophy, the left auricle is able to send an\nincreased amount of blood into the left ventricle, which in turn\nbecomes hypertrophied and sends enough blood into the aorta to\nsatisfy the requirements of the systemic circulation in spite of the\nleakage through the mitral valve.\n\nAs long as this compensation continues, there are no symptoms. If\nany dilatation occurs from disease, degeneration or from increased\nwork put on the heart (and it is readily seen how delicate this\nequilibrium is), signs of broken compensation begin to occur. The\nleft ventricle with its enormous strain is perhaps the first part to\ndilate, thus enlarging the opening of the defective mitral valve.\nThe left auricle is then unable to cope with the increased amount of\nregurgitant blood, and there is in consequence congestion in the\nlungs, and the right ventricle finds the pressure ahead in the lungs\ngreater than it can well overcome. The right ventricle, in its turn\nbeing overworked, becomes dilated, and as a result of the inability\nof the right ventricle to evacuate its contents perfectly, the right\nauricle is unable to force its venous blood into the right\nventricle, and there is then a damming back and sluggish circulation\nin the superior and inferior venae cavae. The results of these\ncirculatory deficiencies are, in the first place, congestion of the\nlungs and dyspnea; in the second place, with the impaired force of\nthe left ventricle making the arterial circulation imperfect, and\nwith the impaired return of venous blood to the right auricle making\nthe venous circulation sluggish, passive congestions of various\norgans occur and are evidenced in headache and venous congestion of\nthe eyes and throat, with perhaps cerebral irritability,\nsleeplessness, and inability to do good mental work.

The increased number of pillows the\npatient requires at night is to aid Nature's need to have a better\nvenous return circulation in the vital centers at the base of the\nbrain.\n\nThe dry, troublesome, tickling cough is generally due to a\ncongestion of the blood vessels at the base of the tongue, in the\nlingual tonsil region, or possibly in the larynx. Later the passive\ncongestion of the lungs may be sufficient to cause a bronchitis,\nwith cough and expectoration.\n\nSometimes, as indicative of primary cardiac distress, these patients\nhave sharp pains through the heart. Such pains are the exception\nrather than the rule, and are more likely to occur in chronic\nmyocarditis or in coronary disease: in other words, in true angina\npectoris.\n\nIf there is considerable venous congestion there may be more or less\nfrequent recurrent venous hemorrhages. This frequently is an\nepistaxis, or a bleeding from hemorrhoids, or in women profuse\nmenstruation or a metrorrhagia.\n\nIt is perfectly understandable from the physics of the condition of\nbroken compensation that anything which improves the tone of the\nheart and makes it again compensatory removes all of these many\ndisabilities, congestions and subacute inflammations.

Often\nthis condition is associated with regurgitation; but in a simple\nmitral stenosis the greatest hypertrophy is of necessity in the\nright ventricle. The left auricle finds it difficult to empty all of\nits blood into the left ventricle during the ordinary diastole of\nthe heart. This auricle then somewhat hypertrophies, but is unable\nto prevent more or less damming back of the blood into the lungs\nthrough the pulmonary veins. This causes passive congestion of the\nlungs, and the right ventricle finds that it must labor to overcome\nthe increased resistance in the pulmonary artery, and hypertrophies\nto overcome this increased amount of work. When this condition has\nbecome perfected, compensation is established and the circulation is\napparently normal. Nature causes these hearts, when they are\ndisturbed or excited, to pulsate slowly, causing the diastole to be\nlonger than in a heart with mitral regurgitation. This allows more\nblood to enter the left ventricle, and the left ventricle, acting\nperfectly on the blood which it receives, causes a good systolic\npressure in the aorta and the systemic arteries. The left ventricle\nin this condition does not become hypertrophied. If the heart does\nact rapidly and the left ventricle contracts on an insufficient\namount of blood, the peripheral pulse is necessarily small and the\narterial tension is diminished. Very constant in this condition, and\nof course noticeable whenever there is pulmonary congestion, is the\nsharp, accentuated closure of the pulmonary valve. The lungs on the\nleast exertion are always a little overfilled with blood. The\npulmonary circulation is always working at a little disadvantage.\n\nThe first symptoms of lack of compensation with the lesion of mitral\nstenosis are lung symptoms--dyspnea, cough, bronchitis, slight\ncyanosis, sometimes blood streaks in the expectorated mucus and\nfroth, and, if the congestion is considerable, some edema of the\nposterior part of the lungs, if the patient is in bed. Sooner or\nlater during this failing compensation the right ventricle becomes\ndilated, and the symptoms of cardiac insufficiency and venous\ncongestion occur, as described above with mitral insufficiency.\n\nAgain, as in mitral insufficiency, if compensation is restored in\nmitral stenosis, these symptoms are improved. These patients,\nhowever, are never quite free from dyspnea on exertion. Any\ninflammation of the lungs, even a severe bronchitis, is more or less\nserious for the patients and their hearts. The mucous membrane of\ntheir bronchial tubes and air vesicles is always hyperemic, and it\ntakes little more congestion to all but close up some of the\npassages. and dyspnea or asthma, or suffocating, difficult cough is\nthe consequence.\n\n\nPHYSICS OF AORTIC LESIONS\n\nNext in frequency to mitral insufficiency is aortic insufficiency,\nwhich occurs most frequently in men.

The cavity of the heart that is\nmost affected by this lesion is the left ventricle, which receives\nblood both from the left auricle, and regurgitantly from the aorta.\nThis part of the heart, being the strongest muscular portion, is the\npart most adapted to hypertrophy, and the hypertrophy with this\nlesion is often enormous. For a long time this large muscular\nsection of the heart can overcome all difficulties of the aortic\ninsufficiency. The pulse, however, will always show the quickly lost\narterial pressure of every beat on account of the aorta losing its\npressure through the regurgitant flow of blood. Sooner or later,\nfrom the impaired aortic tension causing a diminished or imperfect\nflow of blood through the coronary arteries, impaired nutrition of\nthe heart muscle occurs. In other words, an intestinal or chronic\nmyocarditis or fibrosis develops, with perhaps later a fatty\ndegeneration. When this condition occurs, of course, the repair of\nthe heart is impossible.\n\nThis form of valvular lesion is the one that is most likely to cause\nsudden death. In aortic regurgitation Nature causes the heart to\nbeat rapidly. Such a heart must never beat slowly, as the longer the\ndiastole prevails the more blood will regurgitate into the left\nventricle, and death may occur from sudden anemia of the base of the\nbrain. Such a heart may, of course, receive a sudden strain, or the\nleft ventricle may dilate, and yet serious myocarditis or fatty\ndegeneration may not have occurred.\n\nThe signs of lack of compensation are generally cardiac distress,\nrapid heart, insufficiency of the systolic force of the left\nventricle, and therefore impaired peripheral circulation, a sluggish\nreturn circulation, pendent edemas, and soon, with the left auricle\nfinding the left ventricle. insufficiently emptied, the damming back\nof the blood is in broken compensation with the mitral lesions.\n\n\nAORTIC STENOSIS\n\nAortic narrowing or stenosis is a frequent occurrence in the aged\nand in arteriosclerosis when the aorta is involved. It is not a\nfrequent single lesion in the young. If it occurs in children or\nyoung adults, it is likely to be combined with aortic regurgitation,\nmeaning that the valve hay been seriously injured by an\nendocarditis.\n\nThe first effect of this narrowing is to cause hypertrophy of the\nleft ventricle, and as long as this ventricle is able to force the\nblood through the narrowed opening at the aortic valve, the general\ncirculation is perfect. Nature again steps in to cause such a heart\nto heat deliberately, allowing time for the contracting ventricle to\nforce the blood through the narrowed orifice. The blood pressure may\nbe sufficient, or even increased if arteriosclerosis is present,\nalthough the rise of the sphygmograph tracing is not so high as\nnormal. If the pressure in the aorta is sufficient from the amount\nof blood forced into it, the coronary arteries receive enough blood\nto keep up the nutrition of the heart muscle. Sooner or later,\nhowever, the left ventricle will become weakened, especially when\nthere is arteriosclerosis or other hypertension, and chronic\nendocarditis and fatty degeneration result.

The main danger,\nhowever, with a heart with this lesion, occurring coincidently with\narteriosclerosis, is a progressive chronic myocarditis.\n\n\nOTHER LESIONS\n\nTricuspid insufficiency, except as rarely found in the fetus, is\ngenerally due to a relative insufficiency rather than to an actual\ndisease of the tricuspid valve. In other words, if the right\nventricle dilates the valve may be insufficient. Tricuspid stenosis,\npulmonary stenosis and pulmonary insufficiency are rare, and are\nprobably nearly always congenital.\n\nThe diagnosis as to whether the murmurs heard in the heart are\nhemic, functional, accidental, or indicative of valvular lesions\nwould be without the scope of this book. It is always presumed that\na correct diagnosis has been made, or at least a presumptively\ncorrect diagnosis. Frequently more than one murmur and more than one\nlesion in a heart are present. Often one murmur denotes a permanent\nlesion, and another may be one that will become corrected when\ncompensation is improved.\n\n\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY AND TREATMENT OF CHRONIC VALVULAR LESIONS\n\nBefore discussing the treatment of broken compensation in general,\nit may be well to describe briefly the differences in the symptoms\nand treatment of the various valvular lesions.\n\n\nMITRAL STENOSIS: MITRAL NARROWING\n\nThis particular valvular defect occurs more frequently in women than\nin men, and between the ages of 10 and 30, and is generally the\nresult of rheumatic endocarditis or chorea, perhaps 60 percent of\nmitral stenosis having this origin. Other causes are various\ninfections or chronic disease, such as nephritis. Of course, like\nany valvular lesion, it may be associated with other lesions, and\nsooner or later in many instances, when the left ventricle becomes\ndilated or weakened, mitral insufficiency also occurs.\n\nIt has sometimes seemed that high blood pressure has caused the left\nventricle to act with such force as to irritate this mitral valve,\nand later develop from such irritation a sclerosis or narrowing, and\nstenosis occurs. It has been suggested that, though lime may be of\nadvantage in heart weakness, as will be stated later, if the blood\nis overfull of calcium ions the valvular irritations may more\nreadily have deposits of calcium, in other words, become calcareous,\nand therefore cause more obstruction. It is quite likely, however,\nthat this sort of deposit is only a piece of the general\ncalcification of tissue in arteriosclerosis and old age, and could\nnot be caused by the administration of calcium to a younger patient,\nand might then occur in older patients even if substances containing\nmuch calcium were kept out of the dict. Calcium metabolisim in\narteriosclerosis and in softening of the bones is not well\nunderstood.\n\nPatients with this lesion are seriously handicapped when any\ncongestion of the lungs occurs, such as pneumonia, pleurisy, or even\nbronchitis.

Asthma is especially serious in these cases, and these\npatients rarely live to old age.\n\nThe pulse is generally slow, unless broken compensation occurs;\ndyspnea on exertion is a prominent symptom; the increased secretion\nof mucus in the bronchial tubes and throat is often troublesome, and\nthere is liable to be considerable cough. If these patients have an\nacute heart attack, a feeling of suffocation is their worst symptom\nand the dyspnea may be great, although there may be no tachycardia,\nthese hearts often acting slowly even when there is serious\ndiscomfort. When compensation fails, there is an occurrence of all\nthe usual symptoms, as previously described.\n\nThe distinctive diagnostic physical sign of this lesion is the\ndiastolic and perhaps presystolic murmur heard over the left\nventricle, accentuated at the apex and transmitted some distance to\nthe left of the heart. There is also an accentuated pulmonary\nclosure. To palpation this lesion often gives a characteristic\npresystolic thrill at and around the apex.\n\nThe first symptoms of weakening of the compensation are irregularity\nin the beat and venous congestion of the head and face, causing\nbluing of the lips, often nosebleed, and sometimes hemoptysis and\ninsomnia. Later the usual series of disturbances from dilatation of\nthe right ventricle occurs. As previously stated, with the absence\nof good coronary circulation and the consequent impaired nutrition,\nthe left ventricle may also dilate and the mitral valve may become\ninsufficient. Sudden death from heart failure may occur with this\nlesion more frequently than with mitral insufficiency but less\nfrequently than with aortic insufficiency.\n\nA particularly dangerous period for women with this lesion is when\nthe blood pressure rises after the menopause and the patients become\nfull-blooded and begin to put on weight. Also, these patients always\nsuffer more or less from cold extremities. In most cases they sleep\nbest and with least disturbance with the head higher than one\npillow.\n\nBesides the usual treatment for broken compensation in patients with\nthis lesion, digitalis is of the greatest value, and the slowing of\nthe heart by it, allowing the left ventricle to be more completely\nfilled with the blood coming through the narrowed mitral opening\nduring the diastole, is the object desired. This drug acts similarly\non both the right and left ventricles, and though there is no real\noccasion for stimulation of the left ventricle, and it is the right\nventricle that is in trouble, dilated and failing, still a greater\nforce of left ventricle contraction helps the peripheral\ncirculation. The action on the right ventricle contributes greatly\nto the relief of the patient by sending the blood through the lungs\nand into the left auricle more forcibly. and the left ventricle\nreceives an increased amount of blood, the congestion in the lungs\nis relieved, and the dyspnea improves. Perhaps there is no class of\ncardiac diseases in which more frequent striking relief can be\nobtained than in these cases of mitral stenosis.\n\nIf the congestion of the lungs is very great, and death seems\nimminent from cardiac paralysis, if cyanosis is serious, and bloody.\nfrothy mucus is being expectorated, venesection and an", "doc_id": "f05f97f0-f8e6-438b-a9dd-666ce7229888", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b7ed011d2f4dc221a77e57128f4a7c5c626e15d3fc02e7070a5110a212c34fbd", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 339116, "end": 342927}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "eea956c5-5265-43a6-9d49-247ece14c7e0", "3": "04884b93-59cb-42da-981b-28aaab51f085"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "04884b93-59cb-42da-981b-28aaab51f085": {"__data__": {"text": "still a greater\nforce of left ventricle contraction helps the peripheral\ncirculation.

Digitalis should also\nbe given, hypodermically perhaps, but its action would be too late\nif it was not aided by other more quickly acting drugs. The\nphysician may often save life by such radical measures.\n\n\nMITRAL INSUFFICIENCY: MITRAL REGURGITATION\n\nThis is the most frequent form of valvular disease of the heart, and\nis due to a shortening or thickening of the valves, or to some\nadhesion which does not permit the valve, to close properly, and the\nblood consequently regurgitates from the left ventricle into the\nleft auricle during the contraction of the ventricle. Such\nregurgitation may occur without valvular disease if for any reason\nthe left ventricle becomes dilated sufficiently to cause the valve\nto be insufficient. Such a dilatation can generally be cured by rest\nand treatment. As with mitral stenosis, the most frequent causes are\nrheumatism and chorea, with the occasional other causes as\npreviously enumerated.\n\nThe characteristic murmur of this lesion is a systolic blow,\naccentuated at the apex, transmitted to the left of the thorax,\ngenerally heard in the back, near the lower end of the scapula, and\ntransmitted upward over the precordia.\n\nOf all cardiac lesions, this is the safest one to have. Sudden death\nis unusual, the compensation of the heart seems to be most readily\nmaintained, and the patient is not so greatly dangered by\noverexertion or by inflammations in the lungs. As in mitral\nstenosis, any increase in blood pressure--whether the normal\nincrease after the age of 40, any continued earlier high tension, or\nincrease from occupation or exercise--is serious as causing the left\nventricle to act more strenuously, so that more blood is forced back\ninto the left auricle, the lungs become congested, and the right\nventricle, sooner or later, becomes incompetent.\n\nWhen compensation fails with these patients, the first sign is\npendent edema of the feet, ankles and legs; subsequently, if there\nis progressive failure of compensation, the usual symptoms occur.\n\nThe treatment is principally rest and digitalis, and the recovery of\ncompensation is often almost phenomenal. Patients with this lesion\nare likely to be children and young adults, and the heart muscle\nreadily responds as a rule to the treatment inaugurated. Later, in\nthese patients, or if the lesion occurs in older patients, the\nreturn to compensation does not occur so readily. If the condition\nis developed from a myocarditis or from fatty degeneration of the\nheart, it may be impossible to cause the left ventricle to improve\nso much as to overcome this relative dilatation or relative\ninsufficiency of the valve. If the dilatation of the left ventricle\nis due to some poisoning such as nicotin, with proper treatment--\nstopping the use of tobacco, administration of digitalis, and rest--\nthe heart muscle will generally recover and the valve again properly\nclose.\n\n\nAORTIC STENOSIS: AORTIC", "doc_id": "04884b93-59cb-42da-981b-28aaab51f085", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a79d61c69c0e9ed49830d7f93aa4ff4cb326dfbaf4814c4ba273a6271a81d7cb", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 342952, "end": 346610}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "f05f97f0-f8e6-438b-a9dd-666ce7229888", "3": "23c6c0fc-0c12-4cc0-85f3-c7cedd96393a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "23c6c0fc-0c12-4cc0-85f3-c7cedd96393a": {"__data__": {"text": "and the heart muscle\nreadily responds as a rule to the treatment inaugurated.

If such narrowing occurs without aortic\ninsufficiency at the age at which it usually occurs, it may not\nseriously affect the heart. It may follow acute endocarditis, but it\nmost frequently follows chronic endocarditis or atheroma, in which\nthe aortic valves become thickened and more or less rigid; this\ncondition most frequently occurs in men.\n\nAnything that tends to increase arterial tension, as tobacco, lead\nor hard work, or anything that tends to cause arterial disease, as\nalcohol or syphilis, is often the cause of this lesion.\n\nAt times the edges of the valves may grow together from ulcerative\ninflammation, and the lumen thus be diminished in size; or\nprojecting vegetations may interfere with the opening of the valve\nand with the flow of blood. With such narrowing the left ventricle\nmore or less rapidly hypertrophies to overcome its increased work.\n\nThe murmur caused by this lesion is a systolic one, either\naccentuated in the second intercostal space at the right of the\nsternum, or perhaps heard loudest just to the left of the sternum in\nthis region. The murmur is also transmitted up the arteries into the\nneck, and may at times be heard in the subclavian arteries. It may\nalso be transmitted downward over the heart. The pulse is slow, the\napex of the rise of the sphymographic arterial tracing is more or\nless sustained and rounded, and the rise is much less than normal.\n\nIf this lesion occurs in old age, there is general arterial disease\npresent, and the tension and compressibility of the arteries vary,\ndepending on how much they are hardened. The disturbed circulation\nis evidenced by imperfect peripheral circulation and capillary\nsluggishly, with at times pendent edema of the feet and ankles, but,\nperhaps, little congestion of the lungs.

Also, sooner\nor later these patients have little cardiac pains. They begin to\n\"sense\" their hearts. There may not be actual anginas, but a little\nfeeling of discomfort, with perhaps pains shooting up into the neck,\nor a feeling of pressure under the sternum. Little excitements or\noverexertions are likely to make the heart attempt to contract more\nrapidly than it is able to drive the blood through the narrowed\norifice, and this alone causes cardiac discomfort and the feeling of\ncardiac oppression.\n\nIt is essential, then, that these patients should not hasten and\nshould not become excited; and any drug or stimulant which would\ncause cardiac excitement is bad for them. On the other hand, these\nare the very patients in whom, sometimes, alcohol in small doses may\nbe advisable, especially if the patient is old; and a dose of\nalcohol used medicinally when an attack of cardiac disturbance is\npresent is good treatment. The quick dilatation is valuable.\nNitroglycerin will also do good work in these cases, and with high\nblood tension may be the only safe drug for the patient to have on\nhand. As soon as his attack occurs, with or without real angina\npectoris, let him dissolve in his mouth a nitroglycerin tablet. If\nhe feels faint, he will feel better the moment he lies down, and in\nthis instance he may be improved by a cup of coffee, or a dose of\ncaffein or camphor.\n\nIf the left ventricle becomes still weaker and shows signs of\nserious weakness, or if there is actual dilatation, the question of\nwhether or not digitalis should be used is a subject for careful\ndecision. The left ventricle should not be forced to act too\nsturdily against this aortic resistance. Consequently the dose of\ndigitalis must be small. On the other hand, it frequently happens,\nespecially in old age, that myocarditis or fatty degeneration has\nalready occurred before this cardiac weakness develops in the\npresence of aortic narrowing, and digitalis may not be indicated at\nall. We cannot tell how far degeneration may have gone, however, and\nsmall doses of digitalis used tentatively and carefully, perhaps 5\ndrops of an active tincture two or three times a day, and then the\ndrug carefully increased to a little larger dose to see whether\nimprovement takes place, is the only way to ascertain whether or not\ndigitalis can be used with advantage. If it increases the cardiac\npain and distress, it should not be used. Strychnin is then the drug\nrelied on, with such other general medication as is needed, combined\nwith the coincident administration of nitroglycerin, which may also\nbe given in conjunction with digitalis, if deemed advisable.\nGenerally, however, if a heart with aortic stenosis needs\nstimulation, the blood pressure is generally none too high, although\nthere may be arteriosclerosis present. Therefore when nitroglycerin\nis indicated to lower blood pressure, digitalis is not usually\nindicated; when digitalis is indicated to aid the heart,\nnitroglycerin is generally not indicated. These patients must have\nhigh blood pressure to sustain perfect circulation at the base of\nthe brain.\n\nPatients who have this lesion should not use tobacco in large\namounts, or sometimes even small amounts, as tobacco raises the\nblood pressure and thus puts more work on the left ventricle;", "doc_id": "e5a03132-58d7-4548-9fe1-25a74b3849c1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a9e13f7420a16f03d2d2da2f34c08ab98a913c7320cc77203934f5d5a0bd803a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 350314, "end": 354172}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "23c6c0fc-0c12-4cc0-85f3-c7cedd96393a", "3": "00adf599-cf49-4f2c-8c7b-739d6dbca755"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "00adf599-cf49-4f2c-8c7b-739d6dbca755": {"__data__": {"text": "needed, combined\nwith the coincident administration of nitroglycerin, which may also\nbe given in conjunction with digitalis, if deemed advisable.\nGenerally, however, if a heart with aortic stenosis needs\nstimulation, the blood pressure is generally none too high, although\nthere may be arteriosclerosis present.

On the other hand, with a failing left\nventricle and a long previous use of tobacco, it is no time to\nprohibit its use absolutely. A failing heart and the sudden stoppage\nof tobacco may prove a serious combination.\n\n\nAORTIC INSUFFICIENCY: AORTIC REGURGITATION\n\nThis lesion, though not so common as the mitral lesion, is of not\ninfrequent occurrence in children and young adults as a sequence of\nacute rheumatic endocarditis. If it occurs later in life it\ngenerally is associated with aortic narrowing, and is a part of the\ngeneral endarteritis and perhaps atheroma of the aorta. Sometimes it\nis caused by strenuous exertion apparently rupturing the valve.\n\nThis form of valvular disease frequently ends in sudden death. On\nthe other hand, it is astonishing how active a person may be with\nthis really terrible cardiac defect. This lesion, from the frequent\noverdistention of the left ventricle, is one which often causes\npain. While the left ventricle enlarges enormously to overcome the\nextra distention due to the blood entering the ventricle from both\ndirections, the muscle sooner or later becomes degenerated from poor\ncoronary circulation. Unless the left ventricle can do its work well\nenough to maintain an adequate pressure of blood in the aorta, the\ncoronary circulation is insufficient, and chronic myocarditis is the\nresult. If the left ventricle has maintained this pressure for a\nlong time, edemas are not common unless the cardiac weakness is\nserious and generally permanently serious: that is, slight weakness,\nin this lesion, does not give edemas as does slight loss of\ncompensation in mitral disease, and unless the weakness of the\nventricle is serious, the lungs are not much affected.\n\nThe physical sign of this lesion is the diastolic murmur, which is\nloudest of the base of the heart, is accentuated over the aortic\norifice, and is transmitted up into the neck and the subclavians,\nand down over the heart and down the sternum with marked pulsation,\nof the arteries (Corrigan pulse) and often of some of the peripheral\nveins, notably of the arms and throat.\n\nIf the left ventricle becomes dilated the mitral valve may become\ninsufficient, when the usual lung symptoms occur, with hypertrophy\nof the right ventricle; and if it fails, the usual venous symptoms\nof loss of compensation follow. This lesion not infrequently causes\nepistaxis, hemoptysis and hematemesis.\n\nDigitalis is always of value in these cases, but it should not be\npushed. If a heart is slowed too much, the regurgitation into the\nleft ventricle is increased. Therefore such hearts should not be\nslowed to less than eighty beats per minute, or sudden anemia of the\nbrain and sudden death may occur.

It may, however, occur from lesions of the lungs which\nimpede the blood flow through them. Such are fibroid changes in the\nlungs, emphysema, prolonged chronic bronchitis, the last stages of\npulmonary tuberculosis, old neglected pleurisies with cirrhosis or\nfibrosis of the lung, and repeated attacks of asthma--anything,\nwhether valvular defect or pulmonary circulatory disturbance, which\nincreases the pressure ahead and the work of this ventricle.\n\nThe symptoms are those of loss of compensation as described under\nother valvular lesions. There may be jugular pulsation, especially\nevident in the external jugular on the left side. The liver enlarges\nand may pulsate. There are edemas, dropsies, ascites and perhaps\nhemorrhages. The heart is enlarged and there is a soft systolic blow\nheard at the lower end of the sternum. The dyspnea is sometimes very\ngreat, and cyanosis may be present, especially during paroxysms of\ncoughing.\n\nThis lesion of the heart is always benefited by digitalis, but the\ncontinuance of the improvement and its amount depend, of course, on\nthe cause of the dilatation of the ventricle. Strychnin is often of\nadvantage. These patients should rarely receive vasodilators, and\nhot baths, overheating, overloading the stomach and vigorous purging\nshould never be allowed. Sometimes improvement will not take place\nuntil ascitic or pleuritic fluid, if present, has been removed.\n\n\nTRICUSPID STENOSIS: TRICUSPID OBSTRUCTION\n\nThis is rare and probably always congenital, and is supposed to be\ndue to an inflammation of the endocardium during intra-uterine life.\nIn early childhood it is possible that it may be associated with\nleft-side endocarditis.\n\nA special treatment of the heart, if any is needed, would probably\nnot be indicated unless there was associated tricuspid\ninsufficiency, when digitalis might be used.\n\n\nPULMONARY INSUFFICIENCY: PULMONARY REGURGITATION\n\nIf this rare condition occurs, it is probably congenital. A\ndistinctive murmur of this insufficiency would be diastolic and\naccentuated in the second intercostal space on the left of the\nsternum. It should be remembered that aortic murmurs are often more\nplainly heard at the left of the sternum.

The friends of the patient all anxiously await the\nphysician's arrival; front doors are often wide open, and the\nservants and the whole household are in a great state of excitement\nand anxiety. The position in which the patient will be found is that\nwhich he has learned gives him the greatest comfort. If the\nphysician knows his patient, he will know how he will find him. He\nmay lie sitting up in bed; he may be standing, leaning over a chair;\nhe may be sitting in a chair leaning over a table or leaning over\nthe back of another chair; but he is using every auxiliary muscle he\npossesses to respire. He is generally bathed in cold perspiration;\nthe extremities are often icy cold; he calls for air, and to stop\nfanning all in one breath; he wishes the perspiration wiped off his\nbrow, and nearly goes frantic while it is being done; there is agony\ndepicted on his face; his eyes stare; his expirations are often\ngroaning. Sometimes there is even incontinence of urine and feces,\noften hiccup or short coughs, perhaps vomiting, and possibly sharp\npangs of pain in the cardiac region.

Owing to the well known stimulus to distention of\nhollow muscular organs, the heart contracts faster and faster.\n\nSoon, by some disarrangement of the inhibitory apparatus, the\npneumogastric nerves, the heart loses its governor, and the beats\nincrease to even 150 a minute, with irregular contractions, the\nblood being sent through the arteries with irregular force, as\nevidenced by the varying volume of the pulse. At this time, with or\nwithout cardiac pain, which upsets the rhythm of the heart, the\npatient becomes frightened at the feeling of impending demise, and\nthe cerebral reflexes begin to add to the cardiac difficulty. The\nbreathing becomes nervously rapid, besides that which is due to the\nrapid heart. The chill of fear is added to the already contracted\nperipheral vessels, and the surface of the body becomes cold, the\nextremities sometimes intensely so. Next it seems as if the strongly\ncontracted arterioles begin actually to prevent some of the\nperipheral circulation, the blood is piled up in the large arteries,\nand the venous circulation becomes more and more sluggish, while the\nlips, finger nails and forehead become cyanotic. Respiration becomes\nmore rapid and deep; the inspiration being as strong as possible\nwith every auxiliary muscle taking part, thus making the negative\npressure in the chest aid in bringing the blood back through the\nveins. Part of the extra respiratory stimulus comes from the\nimperfectly aerated blood reaching the respiratory center.\n\nTwo factors may normally, without treatment, stop these paroxysms,\nand the \"bad heart turn\" may be cured spontaneously. The first of\nthese is self-control. If the patient does not lose his head, by an\neffort of the will he saves himself from becoming nervous or\nfrightened and therefore escapes the result of mental excitement;\nthe increased peripheral blood pressure from fear does not occur,\nand in a shorter or longer time the heart quiets down. The physician\nrecognizes this power, and gives his patient immediate assurance\nthat he will soon be all right; the patient who knows his physician\nimmediately feels this assurance and is quickly improved.\n\nThe second factor in spontaneous cure of the heart attack is\nrelaxation.

The exhaustion from the respiratory muscular efforts,\ntogether with the drowsy condition caused by the cerebral hyperemia\nand from the imperfectly aerated blood, causes finally a dulling of\nthe mental acuity, and the nervous excitement abates, which, with\nthe exhaustion, gives a relaxation of peripheral arterioles: the\nresistance to the flow of the blood is removed, the surface of the\nbody becomes warm, the heart quiets down by the equalization of the\ncirculation, and the paroxysm is over.\n\n\nDRUGS\n\nThe part the nervous system plays in this paroxysm is shown by the\ngood result obtained from injections of morphin, even when there is\nno pain; hence the action of morphin is directly in line with the\nnatural resolution of the symptoms: it quiets the nervous system,\ncauses drowsiness, relaxes spasm, and thus causes increased\nperipheral circulation; many times this is the only treatment\nnecessary.\n\nDuring these heart attacks it is more than useless to administer any\ndrug by the stomach, as in this condition there will be no\nabsorption, even if there is no vomiting.\n\nWhile morphin is generally indicated, as just suggested, a very\nlarge dose should not be given, lest the activity of the respiratory\ncenter be impaired (it is already in trouble), and undoubtedly death\nmay easily be caused by an overaction of morphin during these heart\nattacks. The addition of atropin to the morphin will prevent\ndepression from the morphin. Also, atropin sometimes quiets cardiac\npain, but it will not steady the heart, may irritate it, and will\nincrease vasomotor tension, although peripheral nerve irritation may\nbe diminished. Hence a fair dose of morphin hypodermicaly with a\nsmall dose of atropin, if respiratory depression is feared, is a\nphysiologic method of bettering the condition. In this kind of heart\nattack a drug which often acts well is nitroglycerin. It may be\ngiven hypodermically in a dose of from 1/200 to 1/100 grain, or a\ntablet may be dissolved on the tongue, and the dose be repeated once\nor twice at fifteen-minute intervals, until there is throbbing in\nthe forehead, which shows that a sufficient amount of the drug has\nbeen administered. This headache will generally not last long. In\nthe meantime the peripheral blood vessels are relaxed, the surface\nof the body becomes warm, the heart quiets, and the attack is over.\nTo hasten the action of nitroglycerin (that is, to equalize the\ncirculation) a hot foot-bath is often valuable. Amyl nitrite may be\ninhaled with the same object in view, but the action is very\nintense, the prostration often severe, and unless there is angina\npectoris, nitroglycerin is much better.\n\nThe symptoms of a heart attack may not be quite those described\nabove; they may be those of sudden dilatation or semiparalysis of\nthe heart, in which the prostration is intense and the patient is\nunable to sit up, although he may be leaning against several\npillows.

HYGIENE\n\nOf all treatment for broken compensation or dilated heart, nothing\nequals rest in bed. Sometimes it is the only treatment that is\nneeded. The rigidness of this rest, the length of time that it\nshould endure, and the period at which relaxation of such rest\nshould be allowed depend entirely on the individual patient; no rule\ncan be established. Most of the symptoms must disappear before\nexercise is allowed. Perhaps a not infrequent exception to the rule\nis when cardiac weakness, generally a inyocarditis, develops in a\npatient after 50. It is not always wise to keep such a patient in\nbed; he may be rested and his exercise greatly restricted, but\nsometimes it is difficult to get him out of bed if he is kept there\nany length of time.\n\nFresh air, sunlight and anything else that makes the bedroom\nattractive and cheerful are essential and will aid in the recovery.\nThe kind of nurse that is needed, trained, untrained, or a member of\nthe family, and the amount of company or entertainment allowed must\nbe decided for the individual patient. The patient must be\ndistinctly individualized and the proper measures taken to give\nmental and physical rest, to prevent excitement, worry, melancholia\nand depression, and to improve the general nutrition of the body as\nwell as the condition of the heart.\n\nEach occurrence of broken compensation in valvular disease causes\nanother attack of cardiac weakness to occur with less excuse than\nbefore, and several serious attacks of broken compensation mean\nbefore long the loss of the heart muscle's ability to recover, so\nthat permanent dilatation occurs.\n\nB. DIET\n\nThe food given should be just sufficient for the needs of the body;\nthe patient should not be overfed or underfed. Any large bulk of\nfood or liquid should not be given. Pressure on the heart causes\ndiscomfort and is therefore inadvisable. Food that causes flatulence\nshould be avoided. Theoretically the patient should receive a little\nmeat, an egg or two, cereal or bread, a small amount of simple\nvegetables, a little fruit, often milk, a sufficient amount of\nnoneffervescent water, perhaps a cup of chocolate or cocoa, a simple\ndessert, sometimes ice cream; in other words, a varied, limited diet\ncontaining all the elements that are necessary to good nutrition.\nThe diet should be varied from day to day to encourage the appetite.\n\nIt has for several years been recognized that a salt-free diet in\ndropsies due to disease of the kidneys is a valuable aid in causing\nabsorption of such exudates and of preventing greater exudations.\nFor this reason a salt-free diet is often ordered in dropsies\noccurring in valvular disease. Its value, however, is not so great\nas in kidney lesions, and", "doc_id": "3dbefa3f-82de-41ff-b90c-55302b467e38", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e469f82d2131e02d75b1849082e78429f801c6784aa8a652eb4b7e1fa738c143", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 376427, "end": 380102}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "bcef334d-4e2a-4421-a680-96032f7f78da", "3": "4fbb9059-bfea-413a-b31c-06fd950ec7f7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4fbb9059-bfea-413a-b31c-06fd950ec7f7": {"__data__": {"text": "a small amount of simple\nvegetables, a little fruit, often milk, a sufficient amount of\nnoneffervescent water, perhaps a cup of chocolate or cocoa, a simple\ndessert, sometimes ice cream; in other words, a varied, limited diet\ncontaining all the elements that are necessary to good nutrition.\nThe diet should be varied from day to day to encourage the appetite.\n\nIt has for several years been recognized that a salt-free diet in\ndropsies due to disease of the kidneys is a valuable aid in causing\nabsorption of such exudates and of preventing greater exudations.\nFor this reason a salt-free diet is often ordered in dropsies\noccurring in valvular disease. Its value, however, is not so great\nas in kidney lesions, and if it causes hardship to the patient it\nshould not be continued rigorously. On the other hand, large amounts\nof salt should of course be interdicted.\n\nA most valuable aid in dropsies due to heart deficiencies is the so-\ncalled dry diet, which means that as little liquid as possible\nshould be taken in order that the patient's blood may resorb the\nexudate in the tissues and not have the blood vessels filled or\noverfilled with liquid from the gastro-intestinal tract. When dropsy\nis present, or even when serious pendent edemas are present, the\npatient should drink as little liquid as possible with his meals,\nand between meals should sip water rather than drink a large\nquantity of it. This is one of tile reasons that a large milk diet,\neven with kidney disturbance due to cardiac lesions, is generally\ninadvisable. With cardiac or general circulatory weakness, a laige\namount of liquid to flush out the kidneys and the whole system, so\nlong ordered for all kidney defects or mistakes in metabolism, is a\nseribus mistake. The Karel diet is described in the section on\ncardiovascular-renal disease.\n\nWhether it is better to give three or four small meals a day or to\ngive a small amount of nourishment every three hours during the\ndaytime must again depend on the individual and his ability to\ndigest without fermentation and putrefaction or discomfort. As\npreviously urged, not too much fluid, even milk, though it digest\nperfectly, should be given, as the greater the amount of fluid the\ngreater the amount of work thrown on the heart.\n\nC. ELIMINATION\n\nA patient who has developed decompensation has always imperfect\nelimination. The skin, bowels and kidneys do not act sufficiently or\nwell. The circulation in the skin is sluggish. The bowels are\ngenerally constipated, or there is diarrhea of the fermentative\ntype. The amount of urine excreted is generally insufficient and\nlikely to be concentrated and show various signs of imperfect kidney\nelimination. Therefore hot sponge baths, with perhaps warm alcohol\nrubs, are daily necessary. Gentle massage, generally in the\ndirection to aid the circulation, will benefit the skin. If the skin\nis dry or in places scaly, oil rubs are of great benefit.\n\nThe bowels must be moved daily and sufficiently, but there should be\nno watery purging allowed or caused. If it seems advisable in the\nbeginning of the treatment to give a calomel purge, it should be\ndone, but such purging should ordinarily not be repeated, although\noccasionally a grain or two of calomel, combined with the vegetable\nlaxatives needed, may act perfectly and without causing depression.\nSaline purgatives, or even laxatives, are generally not good\ntreatment when there is cardiac weakness. The bowels should be moved\nby vegetable laxatives, as aloin, cascara sagrada, or some simple\ncombination of either or both of these drugs.\n\nDiuretics are often not satisfactory in cardiac insufficiency. The\ncardiac tonics which are given the patient, and the improvement of\nthe heart from the rest in bed generally start the kidneys to\nsecreting properly.

The\ncardiac tonics which are given the patient, and the improvement of\nthe heart from the rest in bed generally start the kidneys to\nsecreting properly. A diuretic administered when the kidneys are\nsuffering passive congestion from cardiac insufficiency does not\ngenerally act, and is therefore useless. If digitalis is\nadministered, it will act as a diuretic; if caffein is deemed\nadvisable, that will act as a diuretic. Squills may be administered,\nif it seems best. If for any reason the kidneys secrete less urine\nand become insufficient, the diet should quickly be reduced to a\nsmall amount of milk, cereal and water, and hot baths and local heat\nto the back should be inaugurated.\n\nD. PHYSICAL MEASURES\n\nHydrotherapy is often of great value in restoring compensation by\nimproving the surface circulation. Sponging with hot, tepid or cold\nwater, as indicated, will increase the peripheral circulation and\nthe normal secretions of the skin.\n\nWhen compensation is perfect, in valvular lesions, more or less\nfrequent warm baths are advisable, and often relieve the heart by\nequalizing the circulation. Cold sponging in the morning may be\nadvisable, but may do harm when there is high tension; warm, not too\nhot, baths are of value. Anything is of value that improves the\nperipheral circulation and prevents the extremities from being cold.\n\nThe value of the Nauheim or other carbonated baths is perhaps often\na question. They have seemed in many instances to aid in improving\ncompensation in such patients as have been able to go abroad for the\ntreatment. On the other hand, so many other regimens are ordered and\ninaugurated for these patients at these \"cures\" that it is hard to\ndecide how much benefit the baths have really done. At home the\nartificial carbonated or carbonic acid baths do not seem to be of\ngreat value. Baths and bathing can do harm, and the decision as to\nwhich hydrotherapeutic measure shall be used can be made only after\ncareful observation of the patient by the physician.\n\nGentle massage while the patient is in bed is of undoubted value;\nmore vigorous massage is later often of value, provided there is no\narteriosclerosis. As the patient grows stronger and the circulation\nimproves, the muscles are kept in good condition during the enforced\nrest by massage. When properly applied, it promotes not only the\nvenous return circulation, but also the lymphatic circulation; it\noften removes muscle aches and muscle tire and restlessness.\n\nWhile the patient is still in bed, various resistant exercises are\nof value, and should be begun. These tend to prepare the patient for\nhis later greater activities; the surprise to the heart when the\npatient begins to sit up and walk is not so great if he has\npreviously taken these exercises. Later, when the patient is\nambulatory, he should by gradual gradation walk a little more about\nthe house and take a few steps of the stairs at a time, until\ngradually he is able to mount the whole flight.

There is probably, at least at that particular time,\nconsiderable myocarditis, although the heart may eventually\nrecuperate still more. Pushing it to overexertion, however, will not\naccomplish improvement. Some of the simple \"tests of heart strength\"\ndescribed under that heading may be used with these patients.\n\nGraded exercise was first used scientifically by Oertel and Schott,\nand has been for years designated by their names. Modifications of\ntheir rigid rules are generally advisable.\n\nE. MEDICATION\n\n1. CARDIAC TONICS.-Digitalis: There is no drug that can take the\nplace of digitalis in loss of compensation in chronic valvular\ndisease. It acts specifically for good, and it has its greatest\nsuccess in the valvular lesions that cause enlargement of the left\nventricle, on which it acts the most intensely. It also acts for\ngood on the right ventricle. It has but little action on the\nauricles. This is simply a question of muscle; the part that has the\ngreatest amount of muscle will receive the greatest benefit from\ndigitalis, and the parts that have the least, the least benefit. The\nheart muscle is somewhat similar to other muscles; when we attempt\nathletic improvement in any muscle of the body, we \"train\" by\nstimulating it moderately at first, and are careful not to overwork\nit; the object, then, is to train the heart muscle. For this reason\nlarge doses of digitalis should ordinarily not be given to\noverstimulate suddenly an overworked and weak heart. While in some\ninstances it has been declared that digitalis should be rapidly\npushed to the full extent and then dropped for a time, careful\nexperience shows that this method is often not tolerated, sometimes\ndoes positive harm, and has at times seemed to hasten death.\n\nAnother valuable activity of digitalis is in slowing the heart by\naction on the pneumogastric nerves. A dilated heart has lost more or\nless of its regulating mechanism; this is the cause of its\nirregularity and its increased rapidity. The action of digitalis in\nslowing the heart, giving it a longer rest, and preventing it from\nacting irregularly is of great value. This prolonged rest or\ndiastole of the heart allows the circulation in the coronary\narteries to become normal, and the nutrition and muscle tone of the\nheart improves. Digitalis also increases the blood pressure, not\nonly by improving the activity of the heart, but also by causing\nsome contraction of the arterioles. This feature of digitalis action\nin arteriosclerosis renders its use sometimes a question of careful\ndecision. The dose of digitalis under such a condition should not be\nlarge. It may be indicated, however, and may do a great deal of\ngood, and it does not always increase the blood pressure.\n\nIf the patient is sufficiently ill to require the best action of\ndigitalis, an active preparation should be obtained. It was long\nsupposed that the infusion presented activities which could not be\nfurnished by the tincture of digitalis. This seems not to be true.\nThe greater value of the infusion is generally because it is", "doc_id": "2627b719-174c-44c5-bfcd-1548b5eed278", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a39ee8368b363255f09ddefa6716ca3d846e92d83522aa1287152d7607cafa40", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 387629, "end": 391571}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "ec229d59-e559-4fe1-b978-765fb9fd58a3", "3": "22d7e5da-e22c-4840-8666-877614289b03"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "22d7e5da-e22c-4840-8666-877614289b03": {"__data__": {"text": "and muscle tone of the\nheart improves.

It was long\nsupposed that the infusion presented activities which could not be\nfurnished by the tincture of digitalis. This seems not to be true.\nThe greater value of the infusion is generally because it is freshly\nmade and active; the tincture which had been used previously in a\ngiven case was old and useless; furthermore, most physicians give a\nlarger dose of the infusion than they ever do of the tincture. Owing\nto the uncertainty of the value of the digitalis leaves found in the\nvarious drug shops, however, and to variations in the preparation of\nthe infusion, it is generally better to use a tincture of known\ncharacter. The beginning dose of such a tincture should generally\nnot be more than 5 drops, and it should not be repeated more\nfrequently than once in eight hours. It is generally advisable, in\ntwo or three days, to increase this dose to 10 drops once in twelve\nhours, later perhaps to 15 drops twice a day, and still later to 20\ndrops once a day. This amount may then be decreased gradually, if\nthe action is satisfactory. Enough should be given to procure\nresults, and then the dose should be brought down to what seems\nsufficient and best, administered once a day. The frequence advised\nin the administration of this drug is because it is eliminated\nslowly. Its greatest action develops a number of hours after it has\nbeen taken, and then the action lasts for many hours; the\nadministration of digitalis once in twenty-four hours is perfectly\nsatisfactory for many patients, and more satisfactory than any more\nfrequent administration. On the other hand, some patients do better\non a smaller dose once in twelve hours. This frequence is always\nsufficient.\n\nDigipuratum and digitol, a fat-free tincture, proprietary\npreparations accepted by the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry for\ninclusion in N. N. R., may be employed. They are standardized\npreparations and may thus be more satisfactory than some\npharmacopeial preparations of digitalis, although their claims to\nlessened emetic action are not borne out by recent experiments of\nHatcher and Eggleston.\n\nDigipuratum may be obtained in tubes of twelve tablets. The advice\nhas been given for patients with loss of compensation to receive\nfour tablets the first day, three the second, three the third, and\ntwo the fourth day. This, however, is generally an overdosage. The\nmost that should generally be given is one of these tablets in\ntwelve hours.

The most satisfactory dose of digalen is\nfrom 5 to 10 drops once or twice in twenty-four hours.\n\nDigitalis should not be used when there is fatty degeneration of the\nheart; it should ordinarily not be used when there is\narteriosclerosis, and very rarely, if ever, when it is decided that\nthere is coronary disease. Whether digitalis should be used when\nthere is considered to be much myocardial degeneration is a question\nfor individualization. One can never be sure that the heart muscle\nis so thoroughly degenerated that no part of it would be benefited\nby digitalis when compensation is lost; therefore, many times,\nespecially if other drugs have failed, small doses of digitalis\nshould be tried, to see if the heart will respond. Large doses or\nfrequent doses would be contraindicated.\n\nThe signs of overaction of digitalis are nausea, vomiting, a\ndiminished amount of urine, a tight, band-like feeling around the\nhead, perhaps occipital headache and coldness of the hands and feet,\nor frequently of one extremity only, combined with a feeling of\nnumbness. The pulse is generally reduced to sixty or less a minute.\nSuch symptoms require that digitalis be immediately stopped. They\nare the primary signs of cumulative action.\n\nWhile many patients with ordinary dosage of digitalis may take the\ndrug for months and years without ever showing cumulative action,\nother patients show this effect quickly. They are apt to be those in\nwhom the kidneys are not perfect. The signs of such undesired action\nmay develop slowly, as suggested by the symptoms just enumerated, or\nthey may develop suddenly. The pulse becomes rapid and irregular,\nthe heart action weak, there is severe backache in the region of the\nkidneys, a greatly diminished amount of urine, or even partial\nsuppression, severe headache, vomiting, cold extremities and\nshiverings.\n\nThe treatment of such an undesired behavior of digitalis is, of\ncourse, to stop the drug immediately, give saline laxatives, hot\nsponging or hot baths, nitroglycerin and perhaps alcohol.\n\nStrophanthus: Strophanthus cannot be compared with digitalis, except\nwhen the glucosid, strophanthin, is administered subcutaneously or\nintravenously.

It probably should not be given if the patient has\npreviously had good dosage of digitalis.\n\nThere are many, however, who believe that they obtain considerable\nvalue from the tincture of strophanthus, and there seems to be no\ndoubt that although strophanthus, given in the form of the tincture\nand by the mouth, may not increase the muscle power of the heart, it\nmany times acts as a satisfactory cardiac sedative. Under its action\nthe patient becomes less nervous, the heart often acts more\nregularly, and the low blood pressure may improve. We should not be\nquite ready to discard the internal use of the tincture of\nstrophanthus.\n\nThe tincture of strophanthus readily deteriorates, and the\npreparation ordered should be known to be a good one.\n\nCaffein: This should not be given or allowed, even in the form of\ntea or coffee, to patients who have valvular lesions with perfect\ncompensation, as it is a nervous and cardiac stimulant and may cause\na heart to become irritable. It raises the blood pressure slightly,\nacts as a diuretic, and hence is often of great value when used\nmedicinally. It should be ranked as a stimulotonic to the heart. It\nincreases its activity, but gives it a little more strength. It will\nrarely slow a rapid heart; it will often stimulate a sluggish, slow\nheart; it may increase the irritability of an irritable heart. As it\nis a cerebral stimulant, it should not be given late in the\nafternoon or evening, as it may prevent sleep.\n\nThe most frequent form of caffein used is the citrated caffein. The\ndose is 0.1 gm. (1 1/2 grains) two or three times in the early part\nof the day, or 0.2 gm. (3 grains) once or twice during the morning.\nA few much larger doses may be given if desired. A cup of coffee may\nbe given the patient medicinally: as a substitute for the drug, an\nordinary cup of strong coffee containing between 2 and 3 grains.\nOther preparations of caffein may be selected if desired, or a\nsoluble preparation may be given hypodermically.\n\nCaffein is indicated if digitalis is contraindicated or does not act\nsatisfactorily, and the patient is not nervously excited, but\nperhaps is stupid or apathetic, and also when diuresis is desired.\n\nStrychnin: This is a valuable stimulator and heart tonic when\nproperly used. It promotes muscular activity of the heart much as it\npromotes all muscular activities. It awakens nervous stimuli and\nnervous transmissions to normal in all sluggish nerve functions. If\nfor these reasons the heart acts more perfectly, and the nutrition\nof the heart muscle improves, it acts as a cardiac tonic. Many\ntimes, by improving the action of the heart, and also by the action\nof the drug on the vasomotor center, the pressure in the peripheral\ncirculation may be increased. On the other hand, strychnin in the\nlow blood pressure of serious illness, such as pneumonia, by no\nmeans always raises the blood pressure.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that strychnin is a", "doc_id": "7d6f79ae-851f-4eb2-8bb4-d1496cb7b3d8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "76d8041d040d6ca4e9a48f95fc7113f3efa5c6ff666cd2bb215034e47a1e62a0", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 399256, "end": 402949}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "fd3157a9-9d08-460c-9e86-4ecf32a146e2", "3": "ebb38f71-7131-4287-9ddf-2b07df732edd"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ebb38f71-7131-4287-9ddf-2b07df732edd": {"__data__": {"text": "This is a valuable stimulator and heart tonic when\nproperly used.

Strychnin may cause diminished\nsecretion of the skin. This is not frequent, but it does occur. It\nmay prevent the patient from sleeping. If such be the fact,\nstrychnin is not acting for good in a patient who has cardiac\nweakness.\n\n\nINDICATIONS FOR STRYCHNIN\n\nStrychnin is a much overused drug. It is now given for almost\neverything and during almost every disease. It is true that the\nadministration of strychnin is largely due to the evolution of the\nage in which we are now living. We have ceased to purge and bleed\nand sweat, and to give large doses of aconite or veratrum viride;\nhave ceased to starve the patient too long; we have ceased to load\nhim with alcohol to the point of circulatory prostration, and we\nhave recognized that he must be braced from start to finish;\nstrychnin is the drug which has been used for this purpose, and, as\nstated above, overused. Strychnin given too frequently or in too\nlarge doses for a laboring heart can prevent its proper rest; the\ndiastole is shortened and the relaxation of the heart is incomplete,\nits nutrition suffers, or even irregular and fibrillary contractions\nof a weak heart may apparently be caused. While a large dose of\nstrychnin, even to one-twentieth grain hypodermically, may be used\nonce in serious emergency when it is deemed the drug to use, a dose\nlarger than one-thirtieth grain hypodermically is rarely indicated,\nthe frequency of such a dose should seldom be more than once in six\nhours, and a smaller close of strychnin may act more satisfactorily.\n\nStrychnin is indicated when the heart is acting sluggishly and the\ncontractions seem incomplete, and when digitalis either is not\nindicated or is not acting perfectly. Small doses of strychnin may\naid such a heart during the administration of digitalis. In many\ninstances in which digitalis is contraindicated, strychnin is of\nmarked value. This is typically true in fatty hearts, and may be\ntrue in arteriosclerosis, in which it often does not increase the\nblood pressure at all.\n\n2. Cardiac Stimulants.--A cardiac stimulant is a drug which makes\nthe heart beat more strongly and the frequence more nearly normal.\nThe drugs named as cardiac stimulants, however, camphor, alcohol and\nammonia, do not leave a heart better than they found it--they are\nnot cardiac tonics.\n\nCamphor: This is one of the best cardiac stimulants that we possess.\nIt is a quickly acting nervous and circulatory stimulant, acting\nprincipally on the cerebrum and causing a dilation of the peripheral\nblood vessels. No subsequent weakness follows after a dose of\ncamphor. Too much will make a patient wakeful, a little often quiets\nnervous irritability.

No subsequent weakness follows after a dose of\ncamphor. Too much will make a patient wakeful, a little often quiets\nnervous irritability. It should be used as a cardiac stimulant\nduring serious illness more frequently than it has been; and during\nthe endeavor to make a noncompensating heart again compensatory\ncamphor will often act for good. The dose is 2 teaspoonfuls of the\ncamphor-water every three or four hours, as deemed advisable. Each\nteaspoonful represents a little more than one-fourth grain of\ncamphor. The spirits of camphor, of course, may be used, if\npreferred.\n\nFor cardiac emergencies, ampules of sterile saturated solutions in\noil are now obtainable and are valuable. Such hypodermic stimulation\nacts quickly, and may be repeated every half hour for several times,\nif the patient does not respond. The solution should be injected\nslowly, and as a rule intramuscularly.\n\nMany times while other measures are being used to repair a broken\ncompensation, camphor makes a splendid circulatory and nervous\nbracer. Camphor has long been used as a so-called antispasmodic in\nhysteric or other nervously irritable persons. It really acts as a\nstimulant to the highest centers of the brain, promoting more or\nless nervous control. Perhaps its ability to increase the peripheral\ncirculation may be one of the reasons that it seems at times to be\nalmost a nervous sedative by relieving internal congestion. As just\nstated, after the camphor action is over there is no depression.\nThis is not true of alcohol.\n\nAlcohol: It is of course now generally understood that alcohol is\nnot a cardiac stimulant in the sense of its being more than\nmomentarily helpful to a weak heart. If alcohol is pushed when a\nheart is in trouble, the secondary vasodilatation and more or less\nnerve prostration and muscle debility will cause greater circulatory\nweakness than before it was administered.\n\nTo obtain cardiac stimulation from alcohol it must be given in\nstrong solutions, generally in the form of whisky or brandy, for\nlocal irritation of the mouth, esophagus and stomach; reflexly the\nheart is stimulated and the blood pressure rises. As soon as\ncomplete absorption has taken place, the blood pressure falls. For\ncontinuous stimulation, another dose of alcohol must be given before\nthis depression occurs. This may be in from one to three hours. To\ncontinue such stimulation, the dose of alcohol must be increased.\nThe future of such treatment means an alcoholic sleep with\ndepression, alcoholic excitement which is not desired, or profound\nnausea and vomiting, with peripheral relaxation and cold\nperspiration.\n\nObviously none of these conditions is desirable; but in\narteriosclerosis, or when the blood pressure is high and the heart\nlabors tinder the disadvantage of contracting against an abnormal\ncirculatory resistance, alcohol may act perfectly to relieve this\nkind of circulatory disturbance. In this condition the alcohol\nshould not be given concentrated, and as soon as it is thoroughly\nabsorbed vasodilatation occurs, peripheral circulation and therefore\nwarmth are increased, and the heart is relieved of its extra load.\nIn such instances, in proper doses not too frequently repeated,\nrarely more than 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls every three hours, alcohol is a\nvaluable drug. Such good action of alcohol is often seen when the\nsurface of the body is cold from chilling, or the extremities", "doc_id": "3a8304ea-55d0-4152-b562-8fb8f5eba08e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "014686ed944478bd3db7c8a0b1b7cdb7c34c977c3af8271a55427a8e3e886e64", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 406700, "end": 410570}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "ebb38f71-7131-4287-9ddf-2b07df732edd", "3": "5e9c49f0-2d74-44c2-a78c-2c40b4c1b6d0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e9c49f0-2d74-44c2-a78c-2c40b4c1b6d0": {"__data__": {"text": "none of these conditions is desirable; but in\narteriosclerosis, or when the blood pressure is high and the heart\nlabors tinder the disadvantage of contracting against an abnormal\ncirculatory resistance, alcohol may act perfectly to relieve this\nkind of circulatory disturbance.

Such good action of alcohol is often seen when the\nsurface of the body is cold from chilling, or the extremities are\ncold from vasomotor spasm. A good-sized dose of alcohol, best given\nhot, equalizes the circulation and acts for good. On the contrary,\nit is obvious that, if the patient is cold from collapse and there\nis cold perspiration and very low blood pressure, alcohol is not the\ndrug indicated, although one dose may be of benefit while other more\nslowly acting cardiac tonics or stimulants are being administered.\n\nDuring serious prolonged illness and when the patient has not had\nsufficient food and is not taking sufficient food, alcohol in the\nform of whisky or brandy, not more than a teaspoonful every three\nhours, acts as a necessary food, and will more or less prevent\nacidosis from starvation.\n\nIt will be seen that alcohol, except possibly in a single dose\noccasionally, or for some special reason, is rarely indicated in\ndecompensation.\n\nWhen alcohol is administered regularly, whether during a fever\nprocess or for any other reason, if it causes a dry tongue, cerebral\nexcitement, flushed face and a bounding pulse or if there is the\nodor of alcohol on the breath, the dose is too large, and alcohol is\ncontraindicated.\n\nAmmonia: In the form of ammonium carbonate or the aromatic spirits\nof ammonia, this has long been used with clinical satisfaction as a\ncardiac stimulant. Probably, however, it is seldom wise to use\nammonium carbonate. It is exceedingly irritant, and constantly\ncauses nausea, perhaps vomiting, and often heartburn or other\ngastric disturbance. It has no value over the pleasanter aromatic\nspirits of ammonia, which is essentially a solution of ammonium\ncarbonate. The dose of the aromatic spirits is anywhere from a few\ndrops to half a teaspoonful, given with plenty of water. It is\nthought to be a quickly acting stimulant, with an effect much like\nalcohol, followed by very little or no depression. It is more of a\ncerebral irritant than alcohol, and probably has few, if any,\nadvantages over camphor.\n\nWhen but little nutriment has been taken for some days, it may be a\nchemical question, since ammonium compounds so readily form and\nbecome cerebral irritants, whether any more ammonium radicals should\nbe given the patient. This is especially true with defective\nkidneys. In these conditions camphor is better.\n\n3. Vasodilators.--In various conditions of high blood pressure,\narteriosclerosis and even during the sthenic stage of a fever,\nvasodilators may be indicated. The most important are nitrites,\niodids and thyroid extracts. Alcohol, as stated above, may act as a\nvasodilator. Aconite and veratrum viride are now rarely indicated,\nalthough possibly aconite should be used when there is high tension\nand the heart is acting irritably and stormily.\n\nIf the nitrites, no preparation seems to act more satisfactorily\nthan nitroglycerin (trinitrin, glyceryl nitratis, glonoin). Its\naction may not be so prolonged as other forms of nitrite, such as\nsodium nitrite or erythrol tetranitrate, but it is not irritant, and\nonly a little less rapid than amyl nitrite, and although the marked\ndilation lasts", "doc_id": "5e9c49f0-2d74-44c2-a78c-2c40b4c1b6d0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b7b6765a7508bafe6c680762d192cbf354bfe6dd0404ec6111c4ad29247d2ced", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 410518, "end": 414323}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "3a8304ea-55d0-4152-b562-8fb8f5eba08e", "3": "cc820ac2-b781-4a7b-96bd-93060db0cbe6"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc820ac2-b781-4a7b-96bd-93060db0cbe6": {"__data__": {"text": "stage of a fever,\nvasodilators may be indicated.

In diseases of the heart\nthe sudden vasodilation caused by amyl nitrite inhalations is\nindicated only in angina pectoris. \"Then the surface of the body\ntends to be cold, however, when the peripheral blood pressure is\nincreased and the heart is laboring, nitroglycerin in small doses is\nvaluable. The dose may be from 1/400 to 1/100 grain, dissolved on\nthe tongue or given hypodermically for quick action, or given by the\nmouth for more prolonged action. In sudden cardiac dyspnea\nnitroglycerin sometimes acts specifically, especially when there is\nasthma. When a drop or two of the official spirits, which is a 1\npercent solution, is given on the tongue, or a soluble tablet of\n1/100 grain is dissolved on the tongue, the action is almost as\nrapid as though the dose had been administered hypodermically. Many\ntimes when such increased peripheral circulation is desired and\nalcohol seems indicated, nitroglycerin in small doses will act as\nwell. It cannot be termed a cardiac stimulant, although many times a\nheart acts better and the pulse is fuller and stronger after\nnitroglycerin than before. It should not be used, except if\nspecially indicated, in broken compensation or in other myocardial\nweakness.\n\nIodids: These have no immediate action. The vasorelaxation that\noften occurs from iodid is quite likely due to the stimulation of\nthe thyroid gland by the iodin, and the thyroid gland secretes a\nvasodilating substance. Small doses of iodid, however, when\nindicated in various kinds of sclerosis, have seemed to lower blood\npressure. While large doses may have more of this actioli, they are\nnot now under consideration, and large doses are rarely indicated.\nToo mach iodid has been given for many conditions. If the\nindications for an iodid are present, such as sclerosis anywhere, or\nunabsorbed inflammatory products, exudation in or around the heart,\nor an apparent insufficiency of the thyroid, from 0.1 to 0.2 gm. (1\n1/2 to 3 grains) once or twice in twenty-four hours, after meals, is\nall that is required to give the action desired, and the circulation\nis benefited. It is sometimes a question whether small doses of\niodid are not actually stimulant to the heart, possibly through the\naction on the thyroid gland.\n\nThyroid Extract: In slow hearts and in sluggish circulation, often\nin old age, quite frequently in arteriosclerosis and in every\ncondition of insufficient thyroid secretion (these instances are\nfrequent), small doses of thyroid extract will benefit the\ncirculation. Its satisfactory action is to increase the cardiac\nactivity, slightly lower the blood pressure, and increase the\nperipheral circulation and the health of the skin.

Cardiac Nutritives.--Iron: Nothing is of more value to a weakened\nheart muscle, when the nutrition is low, the patient anemic, and the\niron of the food not properly metabolized, than tonic doses of some\niron salt. It has frequently been repeated, but should constantly be\nreiterated, that there is no physiologic reason or therapeutic\nexcuse for the patient to pay a large amount of money for some\norganic iron preparation.\n\nSmall doses of an inorganic salt act perfectly, and nothing will act\nbetter. As previously suggested, a drop or two of the tincture of\niron, a grain or two of the reduced iron, or 2 or 3 grains of\nsaccharated ferric oxid, given once or twice in twenty-four hours,\nis all the iron the body needs from the points of view of the blood\nand the heart.\n\nCalcium: It has lately been learned that calcium is an element which\na heart needs for perfect activity. Many patients who are ill lose\ntheir calcium, and they may not receive a sufficient amount of it\nunless milk is given them. Even if such patients are taking milk,\nthe heart and the whole general condition sometimes such; to improve\nwhen calcium is added to the diet. It may be given either in the\nform of lime water, calcium lactate or calcium glycerophosphate. If\na medium-sized dose is given three or four times in twenty-four\nhours, it is sufficient and will often act for good.\n\nWhether calcium can do harm in a chronic endocarditis or an\narteriosclerosis to offset the value that it seems to have in\nquieting the nervous system and in being of value to a weak or\nnervously irritable heart is a question which has not been decided.\nTheoretically lime should not be given when there is a tendency to\ncalcification, or when a patient is past middle age. Lime seems to\nbe essential to youth, and to the welfare of nervous patients.\n\n\nEMERGENCIES\n\n5. Cardiac Emergency Drugs.--Besides some of the drugs already\nmentioned (such as camphor hypodermically, nitroglycerin when\nindicated, strophanthin hypodermically or intravenously, caffein and\nstrychnin), often ergot, suprarenal vasopressor principle, pituitary\nvasopressor principle, atropin and morphin should be considered.\n\nWhen there is low blood pressure, venous stasis, pulmonary\ncongestion, cyanosis and a laboring, failing heart, intramuscular\ninjections of ergot, with or without coincident venesection, may be\nthe most valuable method of combating the condition.

Life has been\nsaved in this kind of sudden acute cardiac failure in valvular\ndisease. When venesection is not indicated in certain conditions of\nlow blood pressure and heart failure, ergot has saved life. It\ncauses contraction of the blood vessels and seems to tone the heart.\nIncidentally it quiets the central nervous system. If the blood\npressure is much increased by it, the ergot should not be repeated,\nas too much work should not be thrown on the heart muscle. Often,\nhowever, it may be administered intramuscularly with advantage in\naseptic preparation as offered in ampules, at the rate of one ampule\nevery three hours for two or three times, and then once in six hours\nfor a few times, the future frequency depending on the indications.\n\nEpinephrin and Pituitary Extract: The blood pressure-raising\nsubstance of the suprarenals or of the pituitary gland (hypophysis\ncerebri) has been much used in heart failure. These substances\ncertainly would not be indicated in high blood pressure; they are\nindicated in low blood pressure. They have been given intravenously;\nthey are frequently given hypodermically. They often act rapidly\nwhen a solution in proper dose is dropped on the tongue. The blood\npressure rise from epinephrin is quickly over; that from the\npituitary extract lasts longer. In large doses, or when it is too\nfrequently repeated, epinephrin depresses the respiration. Pituitary\nextract acts as a diuretic. Sterilized solutions of both, put up in\nampules ready for hypodermic medication, are obtainable, the\nstrength offered generally being 1 part of the active principle to\n10,000 of the solution. Hypodermic tablets of epinephrin may also be\nobtained. Stronger solutions of 1 part to 1,000 may be dropped on\nthe tongue, or tablets may be dissolved on the tongue. The blood\npressure is temporarily raised and the heart stimulated by these\ntreatments, but epinephrin is not used so often for cardiac failure\nas it was a short time ago.\n\nThe most satisfactory action, especially from the epinephrin, is\nfrom small doses frequently repeated. Sometimes in serious\nemergencies it has been found to be of value when given\nintravenously in physiologic saline solution. The close, of course,\nshould be very small. In circulatory weakness in acute illness,\nepinephrin has been given regularly, a few drops (perhaps the most\nfrequent dose is 5) of a 1: 1,000 solution, on the tongue, once in\nsix hours.

Careful rules and regulations must be laid down for him,\ndepending on his age and the condition of his arteries, kidneys and\nheart muscle. It should be remembered that a patient over 40, who\nhas had broken compensation, is always in more dancer of a\nrecurrence of this weakness than one who is younger, as after 40 the\nblood pressure normally increases in all persons, and this normal\nincrease may be just too much for a compensating heart which is\novercoming all of the handicap that it can withstand.

Their\nfeet and hands, which are often cold, should be properly clothed to\nkeep them warm. Chilling of the extremities drives the blood to the\ninterior of the body, increases congestion there, and by peripheral\ncontraction raises the general blood pressure.

The decision as to what a patient ought to eat or drink must\noften be modified by just what the patient will do, and, as we all\nknow, it is absolutely necessary to make some concessions in order\nfor him to aid us in hastening his own recovery or in preventing him\nfrom having relapses. Consequently, we cannot be dogmatic with most\npatients with chronic heart disease. Parents should be prohibited\nfrom allowing children or adolescents with heart disease to drink\ntea, coffee or any alcoholic stimulant. The young boy and young man\nmust absolutely be prohibited from indulging in tobacco at all.\nThere is no excuse for allowing these stimulants or foods in such\ncases. If the patient is older and has been accustomed to tea and\ncoffee, one cup of coffee in the morning may be allowed, provided a\ndecaffeinated coffee is not found satisfactory. Whether a small cup\nof coffee or a cup of tea is allowed at noon is again a matter for\nindividualization; they should rarely be allowed after the noon\nmeal. In a patient who has been accustomed to alcohol regularly\n(generally an older patient), careful judgment should be used in\ndeciding whether or not a small amount of alcohol daily should be\nallowed. It should never be in large amounts, even of a dilute\nalcohol like beer; it may be a weak wine; it may be a small amount\nof diluted whisky, if seems best. Ordinarily the patient is better\nwithout it. If he is used to smoking and a small amount does not\nraise the blood pressure much, it may do him no harm to smoke a\nsmall mild cigar once or twice a clay. On the other hand, if a hard\nsmoker suddenly has heart failure, whether from exertion, from\nchronic disease or from acute illness, a small amount of smoking is\nof advantage as it tends to remove cardiac irritability, to raise\nthe blood pressure, and actually to quiet and improve the\ncirculation. It is unwise during acute circulatory failure to take\ntobacco away entirely from a chronic tobacco user.\n\nThe character of the food which each patient should receive depends\non his blood pressure and his age. The older person with a tendency\nto high blood pressure should have the protein (especially meat)\nreduced in amount, as any putrefaction in the intestine with\nabsorption of products of such maldigestion irritates the blood\nvessels, raises the blood pressure, and injuries the kidneys. On the\nother hand, a young patient should receive a sufficient meat diet\nrather than be overloaded with vegetables and starches, to the easy\nproduction of fermentation and gas. Flatulence from any cause must\nbe avoided. It dilates the stomach and intestines, causing them to\npress on the diaphragm, so that the heart and respiration are\ninterfered with. Also, an increased abdominal pressure, especially\nif there is any edema or dropsy, is bad for the circulation. A\ndistended, tense abdomen is serious in cardiac failure. On the other\nhand, a flaccid, flabby, lax abdomen should be well bandaged in\ncardiac failure with low blood pressure.\n\nChildren do well on a milk diet, but it should be remembered that\nexcessive amounts of any liquid, even milk and water, are\ninadvisable, if the circulation is poor and there is a tendency to\ndropsy. It has been recommended at times to limit a patient's diet\nfor a week or so to a small amount of milk, not more than a quart in\ntwenty-four hours.

If such a patient is in bed and does not require\ncarbohydrates, sugars or stronger proteins or more fat, such a\nrestricted diet may aid in establishing circulatory equilibrium,\nalthough he will lose in nutrition. The excretory organs are\nrelieved by the decreased amount of excretory product, the digestive\nsystem is rested and the circulation is improved. Such a limited\ndiet should not be tried longer than a week, but it may be the\nturning point of circulatory improvement.\n\nThe ordinary diet for a convalescing heart patient should be small\nin bulk, of good nutritive value, and should represent all the\ndifferent elements for nutrition. This means a small amount of meat,\nonce a day to older patients, twice a day to those who work hard or\nfor young patients; such vegetables as do not cause indigestion with\nthe particular patient, and these must be individualized; such\nfruits as are readily digested, especially cooked fruits; generally\nplenty of butter, cream, olive oil if the nutrition is low, and\nmilk, depending on the age of the patient or the ease with which it\nis digested. Soups, on account of their bulk and low nutritive\nvalue, should be avoided. Anything that causes indigestion, such as\nfried foods, hot bread, oatmeal or any other gummy, sticky,\ngelatinous cereal should be avoided; also spices, sauces and strong\ncondiments. Anything that is recognized as especially loaded with\nnuclein and xanthin bodies, such as liver, sweetbreads and kidneys,\nshould be prohibited, as tending to cause uric acid disturbance; and\nthe more tendency to gout or uric acid malmetabolism the more\nirritated are the arteries and the more disturbed the blood\npressure. Sugars should be used moderately unless the patient is\nthin and feels cold, in which case more may be given, provided there\nare no signs of gout or disturbed sugar metabolism. Sugar is at\ntimes a good stimulant food.

The most popular of\nthese resorts owe their success to the personality of the\nphysicians, who have made heart disease a life study.\n\nPerhaps the most noted of these resorts for the cure of heart\ndisease is that at Bad Nauheim, Germany, which was inaugurated by\nDr. August Schott and Prof. Theodore Schott, and is now conducted by\nthe latter, Dr. August Schott having died about fifteen years ago.\nHundreds of patients and many physicians have testified to the value\nand benefit of the treatment carried out at this institution.\n\nThe method of treatment largely employed at these heart resorts is\nto withdraw all, or nearly all, of the active drugs that the patient\nmay be taking, and to substitute physical and physiologic methods of\ntherapy. These include bathing, regulation of the diet, and\nexercise. This exercise consists of two varieties: exercise of the\nmuscles against the resistance of an attendant, and exercise by\nwalking on inclined planes or up hills. The treatment is aimed at\nchronic heart disease, to develop a greater cardiac reserve\nstrength; the whole object of the treatment is to strengthen the\nmyocardium, either in conditions of its debility or in conditions of\ndiminished compensation in valvular disease. Any treatment that will\ndevelop a reserve heart strength to be called on in emergencies,\nmore or less similar to the reserve strength of a normal heart,\ntends to prolong the patient's life and health.\n\nPatients with acute heart failure or acute loss of compensation,\nwith more or less serious edemas, should rarely take the risk of\ntraveling any distance to be treated at an institution. As a general\nrule they are better treated for a few weeks or months at home.\nAfter the broken compensation is repaired, a reserve strength of the\nheart may well be developed by a visit to one of these institutions,\nif the patient can afford it.\n\nThe Oertel treatment consists chiefly in diminishing the fluids\ntaken into the body, and in graduated mountain climbing. By\ndiminishing the fluids taken, the work of the heart is diminished,\nas the blood vessels are not overfilled and may be even underfilled.\nThe diet is carefully regulated with the object of removing all\nsuperfluous fat from the body. The third leg of the tripod of the\nOertel treatment is the gradually increasing hill and mountain\nclimbing to educate the heart by graded muscular training to become\nstrong, perfectly compensatory, and later to develop a reserve\nstrength. This particular cure is especially adapted to the obese,\nwho have weakened heart muscles.\n\n\nNAUHEIM BATHS\n\nAt Nauheim, under the direction of Dr. Theodore Schott, baths form\nan important part of the treatment.

These baths are of two kinds,\nthe saline and the carbonic acid. The medicinal constituents of the\nsaline bath are sodium chlorid and calcium chlorid, the strength of\neach varying from 2 to 3 percent The baths at first arc given at a\ntemperature of 95 F., and as the patient becomes used to them and\ncan take them without discomfort, the temperature is gradually\nreduced. The patient remains in the bath from five to ten minutes.\nAfter the bath he is dried with towels and rubbed until the\ncutaneous circulation becomes active. He must then lie down for an\nhour. These baths are repeated for two or three days, and are\nomitted on the third and fourth days, to be resumed on the following\nday. After a few baths have been taken, the carbon dioxid baths are\ncommenced, beginning with a small quantity of the gas which is later\ngradually increased. This course of baths should be continued from\nfour to eight weeks. Unless there is some special reason for taking\nthem at some other period of the year, they are taken more\nadvantageously during the warm months.\n\nBesides the baths, all important part of the treatment at Nauheim\nconsists in the exercises against resistance. These are usually\ngiven an hour or more after a bath, and are taken with great\ndeliberation; their effect is carefully watched by an intelligent\nattendant so that no harm may be done by the exercise.\n\nDuring this treatment the food is, of course, carefully regulated\nwith the aim of giving a mixed, sufficient, easily digestible and\neasily assimilated diet. All highly seasoned dishes, all\neffervescent drinks and anything that tends to cause gas in the\nstomach and intestines are prohibited. Coffee and tea are not\nallowed, except coffee without caffein; and it may be noted that it\nhas recently been shown that caffein is one of the surest of drugs\nto raise the blood pressure, and is therefore generally not\ndesirable when the heart muscle requires strengthening. Because of\nits tendency to raise blood pressure and weaken cardiac muscle,\ntobacco is entirely forbidden at Nauheim, except in a few individual\ninstances, and then the amount allowed is a minimum one. Large\namounts of liquid are not allowed because they distend the stomach,\nraise the blood pressure and increase the pumping work of the heart.\n\nOne of the greatest advantages of the treatment at an institution\nlike Nauheim is the general hopeful spirit instilled into the\npatients, who are so many times seriously depressed by the knowledge\nof a heart weakness and the realization of their physical inability\nto do what other persons are able to do. Also, it is of great value\nto send a patient to a resort where the climate is good and the\nscenery is lovely and soothing. No disease, perhaps, needs\ncheerfulness and pleasantness and lack of anxiety, or frets more\nthan does cardiac weakness. A tuberculous patient may sit on a\nmountain top with snow blowing about him, and recover; a heart\npatient must have sunshine and comfort.\n\nThe results of such sanatorium treatment of heart disease are often\nevident not only to the patient by an increase of general muscle\nstrength, the ability to do ordinary things and perhaps even sustain\nmuscular effort without dyspnea and cardiac discomfort, but also to\nthe physician by the physical signs.", "doc_id": "21047de1-50d6-4d35-94f6-ab510b265efc", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cddda6611f1ab10b74ee4329c031a2cd5758c6b4cd80eafc1e1e172c11b3b0d8", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 444508, "end": 448467}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "a8d38b00-829d-41e1-b309-d4b579a82cc6", "3": "44264483-72e7-4513-a40d-a214086be403"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "44264483-72e7-4513-a40d-a214086be403": {"__data__": {"text": "and the realization of their physical inability\nto do what other persons are able to do.

The heart will often also actually decrease in size,\nand the apex beat become localized rather than diffuse, The liver\nbecomes reduced in size; the urine is less concentrated, and if\nthere were traces of albumin after exertion, these disappear.\n\nIt should perhaps be emphasized that not a little benefit from these\nresort treatments may be due to the withdrawal of unnecessary drugs.\nMany heart patients are overdrugged.\n\nThis sort of treatment is contraindicated in some kinds of heart\ndisease, as heart weakness due to arteriosclerosis with high blood\npressure, to aneurysm of the thoracic or abdominal aorta, and to\nnephritis.\n\nSo many heart patients have been improved by the Nauheim treatment\nthat the question arises as to whether the treatment can be\nconducted at home or in a sanatorium near home, when the patient is\nunable to go to this resort; that is to say, Can we establish this\ntreatment for the majority of patients who have chronic heart\ndisease? Of course, even at home, the sodium chlorid and calcium\nchlorid baths may be given, and one may obtain the salts all\nprepared to make the carbon dioxid bath; the exercises may be given,\nand walking on various ascending grades may be inaugurated. All\npatients will be more or less benefited, provided they will carry\nout the treatment. Unfortunately, the surroundings at a patient's\nhome are generally adverse to perpetuating these treatments long\nenough to develop the muscular strength of the heart to the reserve\ndesired. If a patient appears pretty well, especially if he is\nstimulated by his family to believe that he is well, he thinks the\ncontinuation of the treatment entirely unnecessary, and unless he\ngoes to a resort where he sees other patients with similar\nconditions able to do what he is not able to do, and therefore is\nstimulated to acquire their ability by the treatment outlined, he\nwill not follow his physician's directions. There are several\nsanatoriums in this country where the diet, hydrotherapy and\nexercise necessary for developing heart strength are carried out,\nand patients are sent to some of them with great advantage.\n\nIt has been found that these stimulant baths do not act well in\nmitral stenosis, if the left ventricle is small. If the left\nventricle is unable to receive and therefore send out into the\nsystemic circulation sufficient blood to dilate the peripheral\ncapillaries under the irritation of the baths or the vasodilator\neffects of the baths, the bath treatment does harm instead of good.\nA patient who has mitral stenosis and also a small left ventricle\nwill be found to be poorly developed, badly nourished, and to have\npoor peripheral circulation.\n\nAs elsewhere stated, the improvised carbon dioxid bath, to stimulate\nthe skin so as to", "doc_id": "44264483-72e7-4513-a40d-a214086be403", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e5f1fc0a8e412d4574f808544f3fcdfd25df50bab80170dd3d86e4dedf9b0af2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 448443, "end": 452354}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "21047de1-50d6-4d35-94f6-ab510b265efc", "3": "14ab53a8-06a1-498f-b0cb-09d898f61c7e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "14ab53a8-06a1-498f-b0cb-09d898f61c7e": {"__data__": {"text": "necessary for developing heart strength are carried out,\nand patients are sent to some of them with great advantage.\n\nIt has been found that these stimulant baths do not act well in\nmitral stenosis, if the left ventricle is small.

In\nchildren, on the other hand, the most common disturbances of the\nheart are acute inflammations affecting its different structures,\nand due in most instances to acute infections. Myocarditis and\nendocarditis occur frequently, and pericarditis occasionally. As in\nadults, rheumatism is the most common cause of inflammation of the\nstructures of the heart, but rheumatism causes inflammation of the\nheart much more frequently in children than in adults. Besides this\ninfection, the most frequent causes of inflammation of the heart in\nchildren are diphtheria, scarlet fever, typhoid fever, measles and\ninfluenza, with the frequency, perhaps, in the order named.\nDiphtheria frequently gives rise to myocarditis, which results in\ndilatation of the heart. This may occur in the second or third week\nof the course of the disease, and even up to the eighth and tenth\nweek from the beginning of the disease. The myocarditis due to\ndiphtheria is not always the cause of sudden death occurring during\nthe disease, as such a fatal result may be due to paralysis of\nnervous origin. In scarlet fever, inflammation of the heart may be\ndue directly to the poison of the disease, or it may be secondary to\na nephritis which is so frequent a complication of scarlet fever. It\nis probable that the inflammation of the skin in scarlet fever,\npreventing normal secretion, may be a cause of a sometimes increased\nblood pressure and also of the nephritis, both of which conditions\nmay predispose to the cardiac complication. Erysipelas may cause\nacute inflammation of the heart, perhaps for the same reason.\n\nA certain proportion of cardiac diseases in children, especially\nendocarditis, seems to be due to a general septic infection which\nresults in the so-called septic, infectious or malignant\nendocarditis. There is sometimes a tendency in certain children, and\nperhaps in certain families, for the heart to become readily\ninfected during an infectious disease, more than in other children\nwho suffer from the same disease. Sometimes the heart becomes\ninflamed in rheumatic children without any joint affection\noccurring; the inflammation in the heart may be the only\nmanifestation of the disease.\n\nThis etiology of cardiac affections of children indicates the\ndirections in which therapeutic efforts should be aimed. In children\nwho are under the more or less constant care of the family\nphysician, the possibility of the occurrence of some cardiac\naffection should be borne in mind, especially in children in\nfamilies which are known to be affected with what may be called a\nrheumatic diathesis--families in which several members have suffered\nfrom rheumatism.

It is reasonable to suppose that children who are\ndelicate and feeble, who do not have sufficient fresh air, who do\nnot take sufficient exercise, and who are not properly fed are more\nliable to be affected with cardiac complications in the presence of\ninfectious diseases than children who have had plenty of fresh air,\nan abundance of exercise and a sufficient amount of proper food.\n\nAt the present day it is hardly necessary to insist on the\nimportance of giving every child an adequate amount of fresh air. It\nis possible, however, that this gospel has been overworked, and it\nis not infrequently necessary to caution some parents that there is\ndanger of impairing their children's health by too much exposure.\nThe old ideas of the influence of exposure to cold and dampness in\nthe production of rheumatism have not yet been so far abandoned that\nwe can entirely neglect the possibility of rheumatism being\ndeveloped, at least, by the exposure to cold winds and dampness of\nchildren who are otherwise predisposed to this disease. It is\npossible that the enormously increasing number of children with\nadenoids and enlarged tonsils, who need operative measures for their\nremoval, may have these conditions aggravated by too much exposure\nto the inclemency of variable, harsh weather.\n\nIt is not necessary to state that proper exercise develops the\nheart, as it does all the other muscles; but at the same time it is\nnecessary to caution parents against allowing their children to\nindulge in too violent and too prolonged exercise. Young children\nprobably stop often enough in their play not to overwork their\nhearts. Older boys and girls, especially boys, are inclined to take\ntoo severe athletics, such as long-distance running, competitive\nrowing, violent football and rapid cycling. It should be emphasized\nto school-masters, gymnasium teachers and athletic trainers that a\nboy who is larger than he should be at his age has not the\ncirculatory ability that the older boy of the same size has. The\novergrown boy has all he can do to carry his bulk around at the\nspeed of his age and youth. The addition of competitive labor\noverreaches his reserve heart power, and he readily acquires a\nstrained, injured heart. On the other hand, moderate indulgence in\nwalking, baseball, swimming, rowing and golf should be commended. It\nis not exactly the exercise that does him the harm, it is the\ncompetitive element in it. Until a boy is well developed in his\ninternal reserve strength, he should not compete with other boys who\nare better developed. His pride makes him do himself injury.\n\nDietetic fads are so prevalent today that there is danger that many\nchildren will not receive an adequate amount of nutriment, that they\nwill be fed an excess of such foods as are likely to produce damage\nto their constitutions, or that they will be given food which does\nnot contain all the different elements of nutrition to satisfy their\neconomy and their growth.

A mixed diet,\nnot excessive in amount, and prepared so that it will be digested\nwithout difficulty, is most useful, and it should include in\nsuitable proportions meat, milk, eggs, vegetables, starches and\nfruit. These should all be taken at regular intervals, thoroughly\nchewed, and should not be taken in excess.\n\nIf a child has had an attack of heart inflammation, a myocarditis or\nan endocarditis, greater care should be taken of him not only when\nhe is well but especially when he becomes ill of any other disease.\nIf the child has had a rheumatic inflammation of the heart, or has\nhad rheumatism without such a complication, it is considered by some\nclinicians wise to give a week's treatment with salicylates at\nintervals of three or four months, for two or three years, perhaps.\nIt is hard to determine how much value this prophylactic treatment\nhas. If the child's surroundings cannot be changed and lie is\nsubjected to the same conditions of possible reinfection, it may be\na wise precaution, much like the prophylactic administration of\nquinin in malarial regions. If a child has developed a cardiac\ninflammation during any disease, the treatment is that previously\noutlined.\n\nAn important part of prophylaxis and treatment of a cardiac\naffection during the course of any disease is the prevention of\nserious anemia. During sickness the patient is liable to become more\nor less anemic, but the administration of iron, in the manner\npreviously suggested, during the course of the disease, and\nespecially during rheumatism, will prevent the anemia becoming rapid\nor severe.\n\n\nCARDIAC DISEASE IN PREGNANCY\n\nIt is so serious a thing for a woman with valvular lesion or other\ncardiac defect to become pregnant that no young woman with heart\ndisease should be allowed to marry. Perhaps every normal heart\nduring pregnancy hypertrophies somewhat to do the extra work thrown\non it, but it may easily become weakened and show serious\ndisturbance as its work grows harder and the distention of the\nabdomen and the upward pressure on the diaphragm increase. This\npressure perhaps generally displaces the apex of the heart to the\nleft and causes the heart to lie a little more horizontal. If the\npatient is normal, there may be a gradually increasing blood\npressure all through the months of pregnancy, and if the kidneys are\nat all disturbed this pressure is increased, and there is, of\ncourse, much increased resistance to the circulation during labor.\nThe better the heart acts, the less likely are edemas of the legs\nduring pregnancy. It is thus readily seen that pregnancy is a\nserious thing for a damaged heart. The reserve strength of the heart\nmuscle, as has been previously stated, is much less in valvular\ncompensation than that of the normal heart, and this reserve force\nis easily overcome by the pregnancy, and loss of compensation occurs\nwith all of its usual symptoms.\n\nThe most serious lesion a woman may have, as far as pregnancy is\nconcerned, is mitral stenosis.

An increased abdnominal pressure\ninterferes with her lung capacity, and her lungs are already\novercongested. The left ventricle may be small with mitral stenosis,\nand therefore her general systemic circulation poor. For those two\nreasons mitral stenosis should absolutely prohibit pregnancy. While\nmany women with well compensated valvular disease go through\npregnancy without serious trouble, still, as stated above, they\nshould be advised never to marry. If they do marry, or if the lesion\ndevelops after marriage, warning should be given of the seriousness\nof pregnancies.\n\nIf a woman becomes pregnant while there are symptoms or signs of\nbroken compensation, there can be no question, medically or morally,\nof the advisability of evacuating the uterus. The same ruling is\ntrue if during pregnancy the heart fails, compensation is broken,\nand the usual symptoms of such heart weakness develop, provided a\nperiod of rest in bed, with proper treatment, has shown that the\nheart will not again compensate. Under such a condition delay should\nnot be too long, as the heart may become permanently disabled. If,\nduring pregnancy in a patient with a damaged heart, albuminuria\ndevelops and the blood pressure is increased, showing kidney\ninsufficiency, there can be no question of delay, from every point\nof view, and labor must be precipitated; the uterus must be emptied\nto save the mother's life.\n\nIf a pregnant woman is known to have a degenerative condition of the\nmyocardium, or arteriosclerosis, the danger from the pregnancy is\nserious, and the pregnancy should rarely be allowed to continue.\n\nEven if no serious symptoms occur during the term of the pregnancy,\nand the heart continues to compensate sufficiently for its defect,\nlabor should never be allowed to be prolonged. The tension thrown on\nthe heart during labor is always severe, and has not infrequently\ncaused acute heart failure by causing acute dilatation, and in these\ndamaged hearts tediousness and severe, intense exertion should not\nbe allowed. Proper anesthetics and proper instrumentation should be\ninaugurated early.\n\nPatients who have successfully passed through the danger of\npregnancy with cardiac lesions, possibly relieved by radical\ntreatments, should be warned against ever again becoming pregnant.\nIf this warning does not prevent future pregnancies, the family\nphysician and his consultant must decide just what it is proper to\ndo. It is to be understood that no uterus should ever be emptied\nuntil one or more consultants have approved of such treatment.\n\nSometimes serious heart weakness develops during the later weeks of\npregnancy, requiring the patient to remain in bed and receive every\nadvantage which rest, proper care and well judged medicinal\ntreatment will give the circulation.\n\nIf the heart is weak and there have been signs of myocardial\nweakness or loss of compensation, the sudden loss of abdominal\npressure after delivery may allow the blood vessels of the abdomen\nto become so overfilled as to cause serious cerebral anemia and\ncardiac paralysis.

If signs\nof acute dilatation of the heart occur, with associated pulmonary\nedema, venesection (especially if there has not been much uterine\nhemorrhage), with the coincident intramuscular injection of one or\ntwo syringefuls of aseptic ergot, will often be found to be life-\nsaving treatment. Septic infections after parturition are prone to\ncause endocarditis and myocarditis, and a malignant endocarditis may\ndevelop from uterine infection or uterine putridity.\n\n\n\n\nDEGENERATIONS\n\nCORONARY SCLEROSIS\n\n\nWhile disease of the coronary arteries may occur without general\narteriosclerosis, it is so frequently associated with it that it is\nnecessary to give a brief description of the general disease.\nArteriosclerosis or arteriocapillary fibrosis is really a\nphysiologic process naturally accompanying old age, of which it is a\npart or the cause, and it should be considered a pathologic\ncondition only when it occurs prematurely. It may, however, occur at\nalmost any age after 30, and is beginning to be frequent between 40\nand 50. In rare instances it may occur between 20 and 30, and even\nin childhood and youth. It is much more frequent in men than in\nwomen. Its most common cause is hypertension; in fact, hypertension\ngenerally precedes it. The most frequent cause of hypertension today\nis the strenuousness of life, the next most frequent cause being the\ntoxins circulating in the blood from overeating, overdrinking,\noveruse of tobacco and the overuse of caffein in the form of coffee,\ntea or caffein drinks. Another common cause of arteriosclerosis\noccurring too early is the occurrence of some serious infection in a\nperson, typhoid fever and sepsis being most frequent. Syphilis is a\nfrequent cause, especially of that form of arteriosclerosis which\nshows the greatest amount of disease in the aorta. Mercury used in\nthe treatment of syphilis is more liable, however, than syphilis to\nbe the cause of arteriosclerosis. Although this drug, even with the\narsenic injections now in vogue, is necessary for the cure of\nsyphilis, it probably tends to raise the blood pressure by\nirritating the kidneys and by diminishing the thyroid secretion,\nboth of these occurrences predisposing to arteriosclerosis. From the\nfact that lead poisoning causes an increased blood pressure, lead is\na probable cause of arteriosclerosis. With the greater knowledge of\nthe danger of poisoning possessed by those who work in lead, chronic\nlead poisoning is becoming rare, as evidenced by the lessening\nfrequency of wrist drop and lead colic.\n\nChronic nephritis is often a coincident disease, but the causes of\nthe arteriosclerosis and the nephritis are generally the same.\nAlcohol, except as a part of overeating and as a disturber of the\ndigestion, is perhaps not a direct cause of arteriosclerosis, as\nalcohol is a vasodilator.

Hard physical labor and severe athletic\nwork may cause arteriosclerosis to develop, and it is liable to\ndevelop in the arteries of the parts most used.\n\nHypertension is generally a prelude to arteriosclerosis, and\neverything which tends to increase tension promotes the disease;\neverything which tends to diminish tension more or less inhibits the\ndisease. Therefore a subsecretion of the thyroid predisposes to\narteriosclerosis, and increased secretion of the suprarenals\npredisposes to arteriosclerosis, the thyroid furnishing vasodilator\nsubstance and the suprarenals vasopressor substance to the blood.\nFurthermore. if these secretions are abnormal, protein metabolism is\nmore or less disturbed.\n\nWhile arteriosclerosis often occurs coincidently with gout, and gout\napparently may be a cause of arteriosclerosis, still the two\ndiseases are widely dissociated, and the causes are not the same.\n\nAlthough the arterial pressure has been high before arteriosclerosis\ndeveloped, and may remain high for some time in the arteries, unless\nthe heart fails, the distal peripheral pressure, as in the fingers\nand toes, may be poor in spite of the high blood pressure. When the\nleft heart begins to fail, pendent edema readily occurs.\n\n\nPATHOLOGY\n\nThe pathology of arteriosclerosis is a thickening and diminishing\nelasticity of the arteries, beginning with the inner coat and\ngradually spreading and involving all the coats, the larger arteries\noften developing calcareous deposits or thickened cartilaginous\nplates--an atheroma. If the thickening of the walls of the smaller\nvessels advances, their caliber is diminished, and there may even be\ncomplete obstruction (endarteritis obliterans). On the other hand,\nsome arteries, especially if the calcareous deposits are\nconsiderable, may become weakened in spots and dilation may occur,\ncausing either smaller or larger aneurysms.\n\nHistologically the disease is a connective tissue formation\nbeginning first as a round-cell infiltration in the subendothelial\nlayer of the intima. This process does not advance homogeneously;\none side of an artery may be more affected than the other, and the\nlumen may be narrowed at one side and not at the other, allowing the\nartery to expand irregularly from the force of the heart beat. As\nthe disease continues, the internal elastic layer is lost, the\nmuscular coat begins to atrophy, and then small calcareous granules\nmay begin to be deposited, which may form into plates.

The regions which can stand\nthe disease least well are the brain and coronary arteries, and next\nperhaps the legs, at the distal parts at least, where the\ncirculation is always at a disadvantage if the patient is up and\nabout.\n\n\nSYMPTOMS\n\nThe symptoms are increased tension, which means, sooner or later,\nhypertrophy of the left ventricle and an accentuated closure of the\naortic valve. This alone means more and more tendency to aortic\nirritation and aortic valve irritation, with inflammation, and later\ndeposits of calcareous material, perhaps with stiffening of the\naortic valve and narrowing, aortic stenosis being the result. If\nsuch a patient with the disease advanced to this stage must\noverwork, or sustains any severe muscle strain, an aneurysm of the\naorta may occur. In the meantime, with the advancing degeneration of\nthe cerebral arteries, some sudden cerebral congestion, caused by\nleaning over, lifting, vomiting or hard coughing, may rupture a\ncerebral vessel, and all the symptoms of apoplexy are present. If\nsmall hemorrhages occur in the arterioles of the extremities, of\ncourse the prognosis is not serious. Sometimes some of the smaller\nvessels of the brain may become obstructed and cerebral degeneration\noccur. If distal vessels become obstructed, as of the toes or feet,\ngangrene takes place unless the obstruction occurs at a place where\nthe collateral circulation could save the part from such a death.\nThese are some of the ultimate results of serious and final\narteriosclerosis. The more frequent result, when the disease has not\nadvanced so far, is a failing heart, either from degenerative\nmyocarditis, coronary sclerosis or dilatation, with all the symptoms\nof coronary sclerosis and angina pectoris, or with the symptoms of\nfailing circulation.\n\nWith high blood pressure to the point of beginning endarteritis, a\ngradually increasing force of the apex beat occurs, the aortic\nclosure is accentuated as just described, the pulse is slow, the\ntensity of the arteries depends on the stage of the disease, and\nwhen the disease is actually present, the palpable arteries do not\ncollapse on pressure. They soon lose their elasticity, and if this\noccurs in parts which are soft and flexible, the arteries become\nmore or less tortuous by the force of the blood current twisting and\nbending them, owing to the irregularity of their hardening.

When the disease is actually present, there is nothing to\ndo except for the patient to stop active labor, never to overeat or\noverdrink, to prevent, if possible, toxemias from the bowels, to\nkeep the colon as clean as possible, and for the physician to give\nthe heart such medicinal aids as seem needed, vasodilators if the\nheart is acting too strongly, possibly small doses of cardiac tonics\nif the heart is acting weakly; always with the knowledge that a\ndegenerative myocarditis may be present in considerable amount, or\nthat coronary sclerosis may be present.\n\nAs stated above, coronary sclerosis probably seldom occurs without\nmore general arteriosclerosis. Obstruction of the coronary arteries,\nhowever, not infrequently occurs at their orifices in conjunction\nwith sclerosis of that region of the aorta and of the aortic valve.\nThe more these arteries are diseased and the more they are\nobstructed, the more the myocardium of the heart becomes\ndegenerated, softened and weakened, when dilatation of the\nventricles, especially the left, is liable to occur. Sooner or later\nsuch a condition will cause attacks of angina pectoris and more or\nless pronounced symptoms of chronic myocarditis and fatty\ndegeneration, as previously described.\n\n\nTREATMENT\n\nThe treatment of a suspected coronary sclerosis is the same as that\nof general arteriosclerosis--primarily the elimination of anything\nwhich tends to cause high tension or to produce chronic\nendarteritis. When either general or local arteriosclerosis is\npresent, the treatment which should be inaugurated comprises\nanything which would tend to inhibit the endarteritis and the\nclassification--necessary periods of rest, the interdiction of all\nphysical effort or physical strain, and the regulation of the diet,\ndigestion and elimination. Perhaps there is no greater preventive of\nthe advance of this disease than a diet considerably less than would\nbe suitable for the same person when in perfect health and at his\nregular work. The amount of protein especially should be reduced,\nand the meal hours should be regular. Ordinarily all tea, coffee and\ntobacco should be forbidden, and alcohol should be allowed only to\nthe aged, if allowed at all.\n\nIt has long been considered that iodin would inhibit abnormal\nconnective tissue growth. Iodin most readily reaches the blood as\nsodium or potassium iodid. Large amounts of iodin are not needed to\nsaturate the requirements of the system for iodin, from 0.1 to 0.2\ngm. (1 1/2 to 3 grains) preferably of sodium iodid, twice a day,\nafter meals given with plenty of water, being sufficient; but it\nshould be continued in one or two doses a day not only for weeks,\nbut for months.

Later small amounts of calcium and magnesium phosphate\nwere added to the solution to be injected. These injections seemed\nto lower the blood pressure, but it is doubtful whether they have\nany greater ability than a proper regulation of the diet to inhibit\narteriosclerosis. At any rate, these injections are but seldom used.\n\nAn important means of inhibiting disturbance from any\narteriosclerosis which should be employed when possible is the\nclimate treatment. Warm, equable climates, in which there are no\nsudden radical changes, are advantageous when coronary sclerosis is\nsuspected, and warm climates are valuable in promoting the\nperipheral circulation and lowering the blood pressure in\narteriosclerosis. These patients always require more heat than\nnormal persons, always feel the cold severely, and their hearts\nalways have much less disturbance, fewer irregularities and fewer\nattacks of pain during warm weather than during cold weather.\n\nSimple hydrotherapeutic measures are also necessary for these\npatients, but baths should not be used to the point of causing\ndebility and prostration.

Very hot baths are also inadvisable; but\npleasantly warm baths, taken at such frequency as found to be of\nbenefit to the individual, relax the peripheral circulation relieve\nthe tension of the internal vessels, lessen the work of the heart,\nand promote healthy secretion of the skin, the skin of\narteriosclerotic patients often being dry.

Heart pains and heart aches from\nvarious kinds of insufficiency of the heart, or heart weakness, are\nnot exactly what is understood by angina pectoris. It is largely an\noccurrence in patients beyond the age of 30, and most frequently\noccurs after 50, although attacks between the ages of 40 and 50 are\nbecoming more frequent. It is a disturbance of the heart which most\nfrequently attacks men, probably more than three fourths of all\ncases of this disease occurring in men; in a large majority of the\ncases the coronary arteries are diseased.\n\nVarious pains which are not true angina pectoris occur in the left\nside of the chest; these have been called pseudo-anginas. They will\nbe referred to later. True angina pectoris probably does not occur\nwithout some serious organic disease of the heart, mostly coronary\nsclerosis, fatty degeneration of the heart muscle, adherent\npericarditis and perhaps some nerve degenerations. Various\nexplanations of the heart pang have been suggested, such as a spasm\nor cramp of the heart muscle, sudden interference with the heart's\naction, as adherent pericarditis, a sudden dilatation of the heart,\nan interference with the usual stimuli from auricle to ventricle and\ntherefore a very irregular contraction, a sudden obstruction to the\nblood flow through a coronary artery, or a sudden spasm from\nirritation associated with some of the intercostal or more external\nchest muscles causing besides the pang a sense of constriction.\nPerhaps any one of these conditions may be a cause of the heart\npang, and no one be the only cause.\n\nIn a true angina, death is frequently instantaneous. In other\ninstances, death occurs in a few minutes or a few hours; or the\npatient's life may be prolonged for days, with more or less constant\nchest pains and frequent anginal attacks. Here there is a gradual\nfailing of the heart muscle, with circulatory insufficiency, until\nthe final heart pang occurs.\n\nAnginal attacks before the age of 40, presumed, from a possible\nnarrowing of the aortic valve, to be due to coronary sclerosis, are\nfrequently due to a long previous attack of syphilis.

This is typical. It may not follow this\ncourse, however, but may be referred to the right chest, up into the\nneck, down toward the stomach, or toward the liver. The attack may\nbe coincident with acute abdominal pain, almost simulating a gastric\ncrisis of locomotor ataxia. There may also be coincident pains down\nthe legs. It has been shown, as mentioned in another part of this\nbook, that disturbances in different parts of the aorta may cause\npain and the pain be referred to different regions, depending on the\npart affected.\n\nInstances occasionally occur in which a patient had an anginal\nattack, as denoted by facial anxiety, paleness, holding of the\nbreath, and a slow, weak pulse, without real pain. This has been\ncalled angina sine dolore. The patient has an appearanece of anxious\nexpectation, as though he feared something terrible was about to\nhappen.\n\nThe position of the patient with true angina pectoris is\ncharacteristic. He stops still wherever he is, stands perfectly\nerect or bends his body backward, raises his chin, supports himself\nwith one hand, leans against anything that is near him, and places\nhis other hand over his heart, although he exercises very little\npressure with this hand. The position assumed is that which will\ngive the left chest the greatest unhampered expansion, as though he\nwould relieve all pressure on the heart.\n\nBesides the feeling of constriction, even to some spasm, perhaps, of\nthe intercostal muscles, respiration is slowed or very shallow,\nbecause of the reflex desire of the patient not to add to the pain\nby breathing. The face is pale, the eyes show fear, and the whole\nexpression is almost typical of cardiac anxiety. The patient feels\nthat he is about to die. The pulse is generally slowed, may be\nirregular, and may not be felt at the wrist. The blood pressure has\nbeen found at times to be increased. It could of course be taken\nonly in those cases in which there were more or less continued\nanginal pains; the true typical acute angina pectoris attack is\nover, or the patient is dead, before any blood pressure\ndetermination could be made. When there is more or less constant\nache or frequent slight attacks of pain, the blood pressure may be\nraised by the causative disease, arteriosclerosis. During the acute\nattack with inefficient cardiac action and a diminished force and\nfrequency of the beat, the peripheral blood pressure can only be\nlowered.\n\nThe duration of an acute attack, that is, the acute pain, is\ngenerally but a few seconds, sometimes a few minutes, and rarely has\nlasted for several hours. In the latter cases some obstruction to an\nartery has been found at necropsy, but not sufficient to stop the\ncirculation at a vital point.

Repeated slight attacks, more or less\nsevere, may occur frequently throughout one or more days, or even\nperhaps a series of days, caused by the least exertion, even that of\nturning in bed.\n\nWhile most cases of sudden death with cardiac pain are due to a\nlocal disease in or around the heart, it is quite probable that some\ndisturbance in the medulla oblongata may cause acute inhibitory\nstoppage of the heart through the pneumogastric (vagi) nerves. The\npower of the pneumogastric reflex to inhibit the action of the heart\nis, of course, easily demonstrated pharmacologically. Clinically\nreflexes down these nerves interfering with the heart's action cause\nfaintness and serious prostration, if not actual shock, and perhaps,\nat times, death. The most frequent cause of such a reflex is\nabdominal pain, perhaps due to some serious condition in the\nstomach, to gastralgia, to an intestinal twist, to intussusception\nor other obstruction, or to hepatic or renal colic. A severe nerve\ninjury anywhere may cause such a heart reflex. Hence serious nerve\npain must always be stopped almost immediately, else cardiac and\nvasomotor shock will occur. In serious pain morphin becomes a life\nsaver.\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nWhile a number of causes of true cardiac pain may be eliminated by\nimprovement in any loss of compensation, by improvement of the heart\ntone, by more or less recovery from myocardial or endocardial\ninflammation, and by the withdrawal of nicotin, which may cause\ncardiac pains, still, true angina pectoris once occurring is likely\nto be caused by a progressive, incurable condition, and the attacks\nwill become more frequent until the final one. It is possible that a\ntrue angina may be due to a coronary artery disease or obstruction,\nand that a collateral circulation may become established and repair\nthe deficiency. While this probably can take place, it must be rare.\n\nOccasionally when the intense pain has ceased, the patient may be\nnauseated and actually vomit, or he may soon pass a large amount of\nurine of low specific gravity, or have a copious movement of the\nbowels.\n\nThe first attack, and subsequent ones more and more readily, are\nprecipitated by any exertion which increases the work of the heart,\nas walking up hill, walking against the wind, going upstairs,\nphysical strains, as suddenly getting out of bed, leaning over to\nput on the shoes, straining at stool, or even mental excitement.\nExertion directly after eating a large meal is especially liable to\nprecipitate an attack.

If given by mouth the dose should be the\nsame, repeated in ten minutes if the pain has not stopped.\n\nAlmost coincidently with the administration of nitroglycerin or the\namyl nitrite, a hypodermic injection of 1/8 or 1/6 grain of morphin\nsulphate should be given without atropin, as full relaxation is\ndesired without any stimulation of atropin.\n\nAlcohol is also a valuable treatment of this pain, when the drugs\nmentioned are not at hand. The dose should be large; whisky or\nbrandy is best, and should be administered in hot or at least warm\nwater. The physiologic action of alcohol, which dulls or benumbs the\nnervous system and dilates the peripheral blood vessels, is exactly\nin line with the clinical indications.\n\nIf a patient is home and at rest at the time of an attack, a hot-\nwater bag but slightly filled, or a pad electrically heated, may be\nplaced over the heart some times with marked advantage and relief\nfrom pain. Occasionally even such gentle applications are not\ntolerated.\n\nAfter the attack is over, absolute rest for some hours, at least, is\npositively necessary. If the attack was severe, the patient should\nrest several days, as there seems to be a great tendency for such\nattacks to come in groups, the cause being acutely present for at\nleast some time. But little food should be given; nothing very hot\nor very cold, and no large amount of liquids; gentle catharsis may\nbe induced on the following day, if deemed advisable; no stimulating\ndrugs should be administered, and nothing which would raise the\nblood pressure.\n\nThe question often arises as to whether or not the patient shall be\ntold of the seriousness of his condition. It is hardly wise to\nwithhold this knowledge from him, and generally is not necessary.\nThe ordinary alert patient knows how serious the condition is by his\nown feelings, and will even reprove or joke with his physician for\nminimizing the danger. It is best that the whole subject be\ndiscussed carefully with him and his life regulated and ordered, and\nemergency drugs prepared and given him with proper instructions, to\nthe family, so that he may possibly prevent other attacks and, if\nthey occur, may have the best immediate treatment.\n\nThe acute symptoms being over, a careful analysis of the probable\ncause of the anginal attack should be made. If it is a general\nsclerosis, the treatment should be directed to that condition. If it\nis a myocarditis, a fatty degeneration of the heart or a fatty\nheart, this should be properly treated as previously described.

Therefore with the distinct understanding that\nif the diagnosis is correct the name is a misnomer, it may be\nallowable to discuss under this heading some of the attacks which\nmay simulate an angina and must be separated from a true angina.\n\nTo decide whether pain in the region of the heart or irregularity of\nits action is due to organic disease, to functional disturbance, or\nto referred causes is often extremely difficult. Some of the most\ndisturbing sensations in the region of the heart are not due to any\norganic trouble, and yet the patient is fearful that such sensations\nmean some kind of heart disease, and therefore becomes exceedingly\nanxious and watches and mentally records every sensation in the left\nchest. This is unfortunate, as the patient may learn to note, if he\ndoes not actually count, his heart beats, while normally he should\nsense nothing of his heart's activity. On the other hand, as just\nstated, it may be almost impossible to decide that this disturbance\nof the heart is not due to an organic cause, but is entirely\nfunctional, or due to some extraneous reason.\n\nIt seems justifiable in every case of irregular heart action to\nassure the patient that the condition can be improved, which in most\ninstances is the truth. There can be no question of such urgent\nassurance, if it is decided that the cause is not in the heart\nitself, or at least is not organic. Irregularities in the heart's\naction will be discussed later. At this time discussion will be\nlimited to pain which is not true angina pectoris, but which is in\nthe region of the heart or is referred to it.\n\nIntercostal neuralgia is more likely to occur on the left side of\nthe chest than on the right.

The\nlocalization of tender spots along the course of a nerve with\ndemonstration of these to the patient and the diagnosis stated is\nall the assurance that he requires.\n\nCareful questioning, and if necessary scientific examination of the\nstomach, may show that the patient has hyperchlorhydria, ulcer of\nthe stomach or duodenum, dilatation of the stomach, or some growth\nin the stomach as a cause for the pain referred to the region of the\nheart. Gallstones in the gallbladder may also give such referred\npains. Other lesions in the abdomen may cause pain referred to the\ncardiac region. Not only will the demonstration of these causes and\ntheir treatment assure the patient that he has not neuralgia of his\nheart, but also, if curable, the cause of the pain may be removed.\n\nDry pleurisy of the left chest is not an infrequent cause of these\npains, and of course serious disease of the lungs, as tuberculosis,\nunresolved pneumonia, pleuritic adhesions, ennphysema and tumor\ngrowths, may all be the cause of a referred cardiac pain, the heart\nbeing disturbed secondarily.\n\nA stomach cramp is a not infrequent cause of serious pain referred\nto the heart, and the rare condition of cardiospasm must also be\nremembered as a cause of pseudo-angina. In other words, the\ninterpretation of these pseudo-anginas means a careful diagnosis of\nthe condition, and, as previously stated, not only must the above-\nnamed causes be excluded, but also the reverse must be remembered:\nthat many disturbances treated as other conditions really are due to\ncardiac weakness. The diagnosis of a real angina pectoris from a\nfalse angina may not be difficult. A real angina generally occurs\nafter exertion of some kind, be that exertion ever so slight. False\nangina may occur at any minute with or without exertion. Pain\nreferred to the heart which awakens a patient at night is not likely\nto be a true angina; nervous patients are prone to have such night\nattacks of cardiac disturbance of various kinds. A true angina\ncauses the patient's face to look anxious and pale, with the\nbreathing repressed. A false angina shows no such paleness, allows\ndeep breathing, crying and lamenting, and allows the patient to move\nabout in bed, or about the room. The true angina makes the patient\nabsolutely still and quiet: he hardly dares to speak or tell what he\nis feeling and fearing. True angina is of course much more frequent\nin older persons, while false anginas occur in the young, and\nespecially in the neurotic.

Frequent causes are tobacco, and the\noveruse of tea and coffee. Many a patient's pseudo-anginas are\ncorrected by stopping tea and coffee. The effects of caffein and\ntobacco on the heart will be considered later when toxic\ndisturbances are under discussion.\n\nThe above-mentioned causes of pseudo-anginas have only to be named\nto indicate the treatment which will prevent the pain attacks. At\ntimes, the cause being intangible, it may be necessary to change the\nwhole life and metabolism of the patient, as so often necessary in\nhysteria, neurasthenia, gout, intestinal fermentation and kidney\ninefficiency. Besides a rearrangement of the diet and measures for\ncausing proper activity of the bowels, massage, exercise and\nhydrotherapy should lie utilized toward the end of improving the\nnutrition of every part.\n\n\nTREATMENT OF PSEUDO-ANGINAS\n\nThe treatment of these pseudo-angibas depends, of course, on the\ndiagnosis of the cause, and the cause should be eliminated or\nmodified. If the heart shows real disturbance from this reflex\ncause, the treatment aimed toward it depends on whether the heart\naction is weak or strong and the circulation poor or good. If the\ncirculation is poor, digitalis in small doses may be needed, either\n5 drops of an active tincture twice a day, or 8 or 10 drops once a\nday. If digitalis is not indicated, strophanthus sometimes is\nvaluable. While strophanthus has been shown not to be a real cardiac\ntonic like digitalis, still there seems to be a nervous sedative\naction when it is given by the mouth, and it often does good in\nthese cases. The dose is 5 drops of the tincture, in water, three\ntimes a day, after meals. Strychnin in small doses may be needed,\nbut in these patients, who are generally nervous, it is usually\nbetter not to give it.\n\nOne of the best sedatives to a heart that is irregular in its action\nand not acting strongly is lime; a good way to administer it is in\nthe form of calcium lactate, and the dose is 0.3 gm. (5 grains), in\npowder or capsule, three times a day, after meals.\n\nIf the circulation is good and the heart is strong, and yet these\nirregular pains and irregular contractions occur, the bromids act\nfavorably and successfully. This is probably on account of their\nability to quiet the central nervous system, to quiet and soothe the\nirritability of the heart, and to relax the peripheral blood\nvessels. The dose should be from 0.5 to 1 gm. (7 1/2 to 15 grains),\nin water, three times a day, after meals. It is not necessary or\nadvisable to continue the bromid very long. Whatever general tonic\nor eliminative treatment the patient, requires should be given.

The disease is\ncharacterized by bradycardia and cerebral attacks, either syncope or\npseudo-apoplectic or convulsive attacks.\n\nTo understand the phenomena of this disease, it will be well to\nrefer to the first chapter of this book. Until 1893, when His\ndescribed the bundle of muscle fibers which is now known by his\nname, the transmission of the cardiac stimulus to contraction was\nnot understood. It has been found, by studying the pathology of\nStokes-Adams disease, as well as by clinically noting with\ninstruments the contractions of different parts of the heart, that\nthese slow heart beats are really due to interruptions of the\nimpulse passing from auricle to ventricle through the bundle of His,\nand degeneration in this region is generally the cause of Stokes-\nAdams disease. The auricles often beat many times more frequently\nthan the ventricles, even two or three times as frequently, and, of\ncourse, these auricular contractions are not transmitted to the\narterial system, and the radial pulse notes only the contractions of\nthe ventricles. The phrase that is used to describe this\nnontransmission of the auricular stimulus to the ventricles is\n\"heart block.\"\n\nWhile this disease almost invariably has a pathology, cases have\noccurred in which no lesion of the heart could be found, but it\ngenerally occurs coincidently with arteriosclerosis, in which the\ncoronary arteries are more or less involved and the arterial system\nof the brain may be diseased. It occurs more frequently in men than\nin women, and in them mostly after middle, or in advanced, life. The\nprevious history of the patient has often disclosed syphilis. The\nintermittence of the pulse may be regular or irregular, and may not\nbe constant in the early stages of the disease; but when the disease\nis established, the rate of the pulse may be reduced to forty,\nthirty, or even twenty beats a minute, and it has been known to be\neven less. When these intermittences are regular, perhaps two beats\nto one intermittence, or three beats to one intermittence are the\nmost frequent types. When the auricles also beat slowly, perhaps the\nvagiare for some reason overstimulated and thus inhibit the heart's\nactivity.\n\nThe attacks of syncope are doubtless due to anemia of the medulla,\nbecause of the infrequent ventricular contractions. This anemia of\nthe medulla and of the brain may also cause an epileptic seizure, or\na partial paralytic seizure without any apparent paralysis. It is\nprobable, however, that in these cases there may be coincident\narterial disease in the brain. These sudden syncopal attacks are\nlikely to occur when a patient suddenly rises from a reclining\nposture, especially if he has been asleep. Many persons whose\ncirculation is none too strong may feel faint on suddenly rising,\nbut in a person whose pulse is slow and the circulation weak the\ndanger of causing anemia of the brain by the sudden erect posture is\nmuch increased. Slight faint turns are of frequent occurrence with\nthese patients; or the faintness may be so rapid and so intense that\nthe patient may drop in his tracks.

Slight faint turns are of frequent occurrence with\nthese patients; or the faintness may be so rapid and so intense that\nthe patient may drop in his tracks. Venous pulsation in the neck is\ngenerally marked, showing an impeded contraction of tile right\nauricle.\n\nIf the auricles are heard or found by instrumental readings to\ncontract more frequently than the ventricles, the trouble is quite\nlikely to be a heart block from disease in the heart itself, in the\nbundle of His. If the heart is slowed as a whole, the trouble might\nbe due to diseased arteries or pressure from a growth, a gumma,\nperhaps, or other brain tumor in the region of the pons Varolii or\nmedulla oblongata; or a hemorrhage into the fourth ventricle,\ncausing pressure, could be the cause.\n\n\nTREATMENT\n\nThe treatment of true Stokes-Adams disease is unsuccessful. If\ngeneral arteriosclerosis is present, that condition should be\ntreated. Digitalis would seem almost invariably contraindicated,\nalthough it is of value in extrasystoles without heartblock, or in\nconditions which are not Stokes-Adams disease; but if this disease\nwas considered present, digitalis would probably do harm. Sometimes\nstrychnin is of benefit.\n\nAtropin has sometimes caused stimulation of the heart to more normal\nrapidity. Its benefit is generally only temporary, as most patients\ncannot take atropin regularly without having it cause a disagreeable\ndrying of the throat and skin, a stimulation of the brain, and an\nundesired raising of the blood pressure, to say nothing of its\naction on the eyes.\n\nThe only value of the nitrites is when the blood pressure is high\nand the nitrite action is desired on that account.\n\nCoffee or caffein often causes these hearts to become irritable; it\ncertainly raises the blood pressure, and therefore is not generally\nadvisable. Both tea and coffee should generally be prohibited.\n\nDuring the acute faint attack, camphor is one of the best\nstimulants. Alcohol may be of benefit. If syphilis is a cause of the\ncondition, iodids are always valuable. If syphilis is not a cause\nand arteriosclerosis is present, small doses of iodid given for a\nlong period are beneficial, although it may not much reduce the\nblood pressure or decrease the plasticity of the blood. Iodid is a\nstimulant to the thyroid gland, and therefore it is on this account\nvaluable.\n\nAn excellent stimulant to the heart is thyroid secretion or thyroid\nextract. Theoretically thyroid extracts should be the treatment for\na slow-acting heart. It sometimes seems of benefit to these\npatients, but it often causes such nervous excitation and\nirritability as to preclude its use. The dose of thyroid for this\npurpose would be small, about one-fourth to one-half grain of the\nactive substance three times a day.

The disease is sooner or later\nfatal, although the patient may live some years. Death is generally\nsudden.\n\nIt is understood that this disease must he separated from the\ncondition of bradycardia inherent in a few persons who have a slow\npulse throughout their life, without any untoward symptoms.\n\n\n\n\nCARDIOVASCULAR RENAL DISEASE\n\n\nWith the strennousness of this era, this disease or condition, which\nmay be regarded as one of the accompaniments of normal old age, has\nbecome of grave importance, and nowadays frequently develops in\nearly middle life. If it is diagnosed in its incipiency, and the\npatient follows the advice given him, the progress of the disease\nwill generally be inhibited, and a premature old age postponed.\n\nIn the beginning the symptoms and signs of this disease are\ngenerally those of hypertension, and the treatment and management is\nthat advised in hypertension. If the kidneys show irritation, as\nmanifested by the presence of albumini and casts in the urine, or if\nthey show insufficiency in the twenty-four-hour excretion of one or\nmore salts or other excretory product, the diet and life must be\nmore carefully regulated than advised in hypertension, and the\ntreatment becomes practically that of chronic interstitial\nnephritis.\n\nSooner or later, in most instances of this disease, whether\nhypertension, chronic endarteritis or interstitial nephritis or any\ncombination of these conditions is most in evidence, the heart will\nhypertrophy. As long as the circulation in the heart itself is good\nand not impaired by coronary sclerosis, and as long as this slowly\ndeveloping chronic myocarditis has not advanced far, cardiac\nsymptoms will not be in evidence; but if these conditions occur, or\nif the blood pressure is so greatly increased as to damage the\naortic valve or strain and dilate the left ventricle, symptoms\nrapidly appear, and the heart must be carefully watched.\nSubsequently, as the disease advances, if the patient does not die\nof angina pectoris, apoplexy or uremia, the symptoms of cardiac\ndecompensation will develop. As the heart begins to fail, a\ndilatation of the right ventricle causes passive congestion of the\nkidneys, and the chronic interstitial nephritis may progress more\nrapidly. It is often difficult to decide which is more in evidence,\nheart insufficiency or kidney insufficiency.

The patient is likely to be\noverweight or adding weight, and to suffer from intestinal\nindigestions. Signs of sclerosis of the blood vessels of the brain\nare evidenced by transient dizziness; headaches; impaired sleep;\nloss of memory, especially for names and words; slight disturbances\nof speech, momentary perhaps, and more or less temporary localized\nnumbness of the hands or feet, or arms or legs, with perhaps\nflushing of some part of the body, or little localized spasms of\nvessels of other parts of the body, causing chilliness.\n\nThere is also a marked hereditary tendency to apoplexy.\n\nCadwalader, [Footnote: Cadwalader, W. R.: A Comparison of the Onset\nand Character of the Apoplexy Caused by Cerebral Hemorrhage and by\nVascular Occlusion, The Journal A. M. A., May 2, 1914, p. 1385.]\nafter considerable investigation, has come to the conclusion that\nlarge hemorrhages into the brain are the rule in apoplexy, and that\nsmall hemorrhages are rare, and he is inclined to think that even\nsmall, as well as large hemorrhages, are more frequently fatal than\nsupposed. In other words, he thinks that many of the nonfatal\nhemiplegias are caused by vascular obstruction and softening and not\nby hemorrhage. He finds that sudden death, or death within a few\nminutes, does not occur from hemorrhage, even if the hemorrhage is\nlarge, though a rapidly developing and persistent coma usually\nindicates a hemorrhage. If the coma is not profound and is slow in\nits onset, with symptoms noticed by the patient, and cerebral\ndisturbance, he believes it to be caused generally by softening of\nthe cerebral center, due to some obstruction of the blood flow, and\nnot to hemorrhage. While occasionally a slowly increasing loss of\nconsciousness may be due to hemorrhage, he thinks it is doubtful if\nreal hemorrhage ever occurs without loss of consciousness, while\nsoftening of some part of the cerebrum may occur without\nunconsciousness.

It is\nbetter not to use drugs of any kind in this incipient condition. The\nhypertension should be regulated by the diet; the purin bases and\nmeat should be reduced to a minimum; tea, coffee and alcohol should\nbe prohibited, and tobacco should be either entirely stopped or\nreduced to a minimum. Regulated exercise is always advisable, the\namount of such exercise depending on the condition of the\ncirculation. Ordinary walking and graduated walking or graduated\nhill climbing and golfing are good exercise for these patients.\nMental and physical strenuosity must be stopped, if the disease is\nto be slowed. Sleeplessness must be combated, and perhaps actually\ntreated medicinally, and for a time sufficient doses of chloral are\nperhaps the best treatment. The administration of chloral must\nalways be carefully guarded to avoid the acquirement of dependence\non the drug. Mouth and other infections should be sought and\nremoved. Warm baths, Turkish baths, electric light baths or body\nbaking may be advisable, and certainly obesity must always be\ncombated by a regulation of the diet. In obesity, stimulants to the\nappetite, such as spices, condiments, and even sometimes salt, must\nbe prohibited. Butter, cream, sugar and starches must be reduced to\na minimum. A small amount of bread and a small amount of potatoes\nshould be allowed. Liquids with meals should be reduced. Fruits\nshould be given freely. Intestinal indigestion should be corrected,\nand free daily movements of the bowels should be caused. If the\npatient is obese, and especially if the blood pressure is high, the\nadministration of thyroid extract is very beneficial. This is\nparticularly true in women suffering from this disease; but the\npatient should be carefully observed during its administration. It\nmay be advisable to administer small doses of iodid instead of the\nthyroid treatment, or coincidently with it. Nitrites had better be\npostponed, if possible, for cardiac emergencies.\n\nWhite, [Footnote: White: Boston Med. and Surg. Jour., Dec. 2, 1915.]\nafter studying 200 cases of heart disease, finds that men are more\nsubject to auricular fibrillation, auricular flutter, heart block\nand alternation of the pulse than are women. The greater frequency\nof syphilis in men than in women should be considered in this\ndifference in frequency.\n\nWhite finds that hyperthyroidism of long standing is often attended\nwith auricular fibrillation.

It may be found near 100 on the least\nexertion, even after some minutes of rest. These patients must have\nmore or less absolute bed rest. When this condition occurs in old\nage, however, prolonged bed rest is inadvisable, for if the heart\nonce loses its energy, in such cases, it is practically impossible\nto cause a return of normal function. However, in all acute cardiac\ninsufficiency in this disease, due to some heart strain or exertion\nthat was unusual, a bed rest of from one to two weeks and then\ngradually getting up and returning to normal activity is the proper\ntreatment, and will generally be successful in restoring more or\nless compensation. These patients may well recline in bed with\nseveral pillows or with a back rest. During any cardiac anxiety in\nthis kind of insufficiency the patient breathes better when he is\nsitting up or reclining with the head and shoulders high. The reason\nfor this is probably because his heart has more space in this\nposition--the same reason that he breathes better when his stomach\nis empty. Very indicative of the coming cardiac insufficiency is the\ninability to lie at night on the left side. The pressure of the\nbody, especially if the person is stout, interferes with the heart\naction and causes dyspnea and distress. Some short, fat patients\nwith cardiac distress caused by this disease must even stand up to\nrelieve the condition, the erect position giving still more space\nfor the action of the heart.\n\nBefore these patients get up, after a period of bed rest, slight\nexercises should be done, perhaps resistant exercises, to see what\nthe effect is on the heart, and also gradually to cause increase in\ncardiac strength, much as any other training exercise. Whatever\nexercise increases the heart rate more than twenty-five beats is too\nstrenuous at that particular period. The exercise should then be\nstill more carefully graduated. If the systolic blood pressure is\naltogether too low for the age of the person or for the previous\nhistory, it should be allowed to become higher, if possible, before\nmuch exercise is begun.\n\nThe diet should be nutritious, but, of course, modified by the\ncondition of the stomach, intestines and kidneys, and whether or not\nthe patient is obese. The bulk of the meal should be small, and\nnutriment should be given at three or four hour intervals during the\ndaytime.\n\nThe Karell milk diet or so-called \"cure\" was first presented in 1865\nby Phillippe Karell, physician to the Czar of Russia. This treatment\nwas more or less forgotten until lately, when it has been more\nfrequently used in kidney, liver and heart insufficiency. Its main\nobject in kidney and heart disease is to remove dropsies. In cardiac\ndropsy it is advised to give 200 c.c. of milk for four doses at four\nhour intervals, beginning at 8 o'clock in the morning.

During the\nnext two days an egg is added to this treatment, given about 10\no'clock in the morning, and a slice of dry toast, or zwieback, at 6\np. m. Then up to the twelfth day the food is gradually increased,\nfirst to two eggs a day, then more bread, then a little chopped\nmeat, then rice or some cereal, and by the end of two weeks the\npatient is about back to his ordinary diet. During this period the\nbowels are moved by enema or by some vegetable cathartic, or even\ncastor oil. If thirst is excessive, the patient must have a little\nwater, and if the desire for solid food is excessive, even Karell\nallowed a little white bread and at times a little salt. He\nsometimes even prolonged the period of treatment to five or six\nweeks.\n\nVarious modifications of this treatment have been suggested, such as\nskimmed milk, and more in quantity, or a cereal is added more or\nless from the beginning, and perhaps cream. The diuretic action of\nthis treatment is not always successful. Also, sometimes the\ntreatment is even dangerous, the heart and circulation becoming\nweaker than before such treatment was begun. Certainly the treatment\nshould be used in cardiac insufficiency with a great deal of care,\nalthough it is often very valuable treatment. It should be\nemphasized that most patients with cardiac dropsy receiving the\nKarell treatment or a modification of it should also receive\ndigitalis in full doses, and should have daily free movement of the\nbowels. It should be urged, however, that too free catharsis in\ncardiac weakness is to be avoided, and the prolonged use of salines,\nand sometimes even one administration is contraindicated. Before\ncardiac failure has occurred in this disease, once a week a dose of\ncalomel or a brisk saline purge is advisable, and is good treatment;\nbut when cardiac weakness has developed, free catharsis is rarely\nindicated, although the bowels should be daily moved, and vegetable\nlaxatives are the best treatment. The upper intestine and the liver\nand kidneys may be relieved by a more or less abrupt modification of\nthe diet, or even a starvation period, and the bowels will generally\nbecome cleaned; but frequent profuse purging with salines or some\ndrastic cathartic puts the final touch on a cardiac failure.\n\nRecently Goodman [Footnote: Goodman, E.

Sometimes\nthe diastolic pressure is high and the systolic low and the pressure\npulse small because of heart insufficiency; such a condition is\noften improved by digitalis. In other words, with a failing heart\ndigitalis may not make a blood pressure higher, and often does not;\nit may even lower a diastolic pressure, and the moment that the\npressure pulse becomes sufficient, the patient improves. Under this\ntreatment of digitalis, rest and regulated diet, a dilated left\nventricle with a systolic mitral blow often becomes contracted and\nthis regurgitation disappears.\n\nThe amount of digitalis that is advisable has been frequently\ndiscussed. It should be given in the best preparation obtainable,\nand should be pushed gradually (not suddenly) to the point of full\nphysiologic activity. While it may be given at first three times a\nday in smaller doses, it later should be given but twice a day, and\nstill later once a day, in a dose sufficient to cause the results.\nAs soon as the full activity has been reached it may be intermitted\nfor a short time; or it may be given a longer time in smaller\ndosage. In renal insufficiency associated with cardiac\ninsufficiency, its action is subject to careful watching. If there\nis marked advanced interstitial nephritis, digitalis may not work\nsatisfactorily and must be used with caution. If, on the other hand,\na large part of the kidney trouble is due to the passive congestion\ncaused by circulatory weakness, digitalis will be valuable.\n\nIn sudden cardiac insufficiency, provided digitalis has not been\ngiven in large doses a short time before, strophanthin may be given\nintravenously once or at most twice at twenty-four-hour intervals.\n\nIf, in this more or less serious condition of the heart weakness,\nthere is great sleeplessness, a hypnotic must sometimes be given,\nand the safest hypnotic is perhaps 3 / 10 grain of morphin.

While an intermittent pulse is of course abnormal,\nit may be caused in certain persons by a condition which does not in\nthe least interfere with their health and well-being.\n\nAs to whether a slow or a more or less (but not excessively) rapid\npulse in any one is abnormal depends entirely on whether that speed\nis normal or abnormal for that person. As a general rule the heart\nis more rapid in women than in men. It is always more rapid in\nchildren than in adults, and generally diminishes in frequence after\nthe age of 60, unless there is cardiac weakness or some cardiac\nmuscle degeneration. The average frequence of the pulse in an adult\nwho is at rest is 72 beats per minute, but a frequency of 80 is not\nabnormal, and a frequency of 65 in men is common; 60 is infrequent\nin men but normal, while up to 90 is not abnormal, especially in\nwomen, at the time the pulse is being counted.' It should always be\nconsidered that in the majority of patients the pulse is slightly\nincreased while the physician is noting its rapidity. Anything over\n90 should always be considered rapid, unless the patient is very\nnervous and this rapidity is considered accidental. Anything below\n60 is abnormally slow. In children under 10 or 12 years of age,\nanything below 80 is unusual, and up to 100 is perfectly normal, at\nleast at such time as the pulse is counted and the patient is awake.\n\nReferring to the first chapter of this book, it will be noted that\nmany physiologic factors must enter into the production of the\nnormal regularity of the pulse. The stimulus must regularly begin in\nthe auricle, must be perfectly transmitted through the bundle of His\nto the ventricles, the ventricles must normally contract with the\nnormal and regular force, the valves must close normally and at the\nproper time, the blood pressure in the aorta must be normally\nconstant to insure the perfect transmission of the blood to the\nperipheral arteries and to insure the normal circulation through the\ncoronary arteries, and the arterioles must be normally elastic. The\nnervous inhibitory control through the vagi must also be normal, and\nthere must be no abnormal reflexes of any part of the body to\ninterfere with the normal vagus control of the heart.\n\nWhile the heart beats from an inherent musculonervous mechanism,\nnervous interference easily upsets its normal regularity. It may be\nseriously slowed by nervous shock, fear or sudden peripheral\ncontractions, spasm of muscles, or convulsive contractions, or it\nmay be stimulated to greater rapidity by nervous excitement.

Various\nkinds of poisons circulating in the blood, both depressants and\nexcitants, may affect the rapidity or the regularity of the heart.\nTherefore, if it is decided that a given heart is abnormally slow or\nabnormally rapid or is decidedly irregular or intermittent, the\nvarious causes for such interference with its normal activity must\nbe investigated and admitted or excluded as causative factors.\n\nMany investigations of the rhythm of children's pulses have been\nmade, and some of the later investigations seem to show that not\nmore than 40 percent are regular, the remaining 60 percent varying\nfrom mild irregularity to extreme irregularity.\n\nScientifically to determine the exact character of a pulse which is\ndiscovered by the finger on the radial artery and the stethoscope on\nthe heart to be irregular, tracings of one or more arteries, veins\nand the heart should be taken. Two synchronous tracings are more\naccurate than one, and three of more value than two in interpreting\nthe exact activity and regularity of the heart.\n\n\nETIOLOGY\n\nThe cause of an irregularly acting heart in an adult may be organic,\nas in the various forms of myocarditis, in broken compensation of\nvalvular disease, Stokes-Adams disease, coronary disease, auricular\nfibrillation, auricular flutter, cerebral disease, and toxemias from\nvarious kinds of serious organic disease. The cause may be more or\nless functional and removable, such as tea, coffee, alcohol,\ntobacco, gastric indigestion and intestinal toxemia; or it may be\ndue to functional disturbances of the heart, such as that due to\nwhat has been termed extrasystole, or to irregular ventricular\ncontractions. A frequent cause of irregular heart action in women,\nmore especially of increased rapidity, is hyperthyroidism.\n\nThere may be an arrhythmia due to some nervous stimulation, probably\nthrough the pneumogastric, so that the pulse varies abnormally\nduring respiration, being accelerated during inspiration and\nretarded during expiration more than is normally found in adults.\nThis condition is frequent in children, and is noticed in neurotic\nadults and sometimes during convalescence from a serious illness.\nNervous and physical rest, with plenty of sleep and fresh, clean air\nso that the respiratory center is normally stiniulated, will\ngenerally improve this condition in an adult.\n\nExtrasystoles causing arrhythmia give a more or less regularly\nintermittent pulse, while the examination of the heart discloses an\nimperfect beat or the extrasystole which is not transmitted or acted\non by the ventricles, and hence the intermittency in the peripheral\narteries. This condition may be due to some toxemia, nervous\nirritability, or some irritation in the heart muscle.

This disease is not frequent, while\nextrasystoles of a functional character are very frequent. Sometimes\nthis functional disease persists without any apparent injury to the\nindividual as long as the ventricle does not take note of these\nextra auricular systoles and does not also become extra rapid.

If digitalis should, however, cause the heart\nto become more irritable, it is acting for harm, and should be\nstopped.\n\n\nTREATMENT\n\nOne has but to refer to the enumerated causes of irregular heart\naction to determine the treatment. In that caused by extrasystole,\nthe treatment has just been suggested. In irregular heart caused by\nserious cardiac or other lesions the treatment has already been\ndescribed, or is that of the disease that has a badly acting heart\nas a complication. If the irregularity is caused by toxins, the\ntreatment is to stop the ingestion of the toxin and to promote the\nelimination of what is already in the system; how much of the\nirregularity was due to the toxin and how much is inherent\ndisturbance in the heart can then be determined. If the cause of a\ntoxemia developed in the system, perhaps most frequently from\nintestinal putrefaction, increased elimination and a regulation of\nthe diet will cure the condition.\n\nThe valvular lesions most apt to cause irregular action of the heart\nare mitral insufficiency or mitral stenosis. The lesion which is\nmost apt to cause auricular fibrillation and more or less\npermanently irregular heart is perhaps mitral stenosis. Another\nfrequent cause of more or less permanent irregularity is the\nexcessive use of alcohol.\n\nWhile an irregular pulse and an irregular heart are always of more\nor less serious import, still, as the extrasystoles of the auricle\nare better understood and more frequently recognized, and the habits\nand life of the patients (most frequently men) are regulated and\nrevised, frequently a pulse and heart which would be rejected by any\nmedical examiner for an insurance company becomes, in a few weeks or\na few months, a perfectly acting heart, and remains so sometimes for\nyears.

At times auricular fibrillation is only a passing\nsymptom, and is rapidly cured by treatment. A real auricular\nfibrillation shows a semiparalysis of the auricles, and during this\ncondition normal systolic contractions do not occur, although there\nare small rapid twitchings of different muscle fibers in the\nauricles. Although it was once thought that the auricle was\nparalyzed in this condition, it probably simply loses its coordinate\nactivity. Auricular fibrillation and auricular flutter are probably\nsimply different degrees of the same condition, and any contractions\nof the auricles over 200 per minute may be termed an auricular\nflutter, and below that the term auricular fibrillation may be used.\nWhen ventricular fibrillation occurs, the condition is serious and\nthe prognosis bad. Both auricular fibrillation and auricular flutter\nmay be temporary or permanent, and the exact number of fibrillations\nor tremblings of the auricular muscle can be noted only by\nelectrical instruments.\n\nTallman, [Footnote: Tallman: Northwest Med., May, 1916] after\nexamination of fifty-eight cases, classifies different types of\nauricular flutter: (1) such a condition in an apparently normal\nheart; (2) the condition occurring during chronic heart disease, and\n(3) an auricular flutter with partial or complete heart block.\n\nThe irregular pulse in auricular fibrillation is more or less\ndistinctive, being generally rapid, from 110 upward. Occasionally\nthe pulse rate may be much slower, if the heart is under the\ninfluence of digitalis. The irregularity of the pulse in this\ncondition is excessive; the rate, strength and apparent\nintermittency during a half minute may not at all represent the\ncondition in the next half minute, or in the next several minutes.\nIf digitalis does not cure the irregularity, the condition has been\ntermed the \"absolutely irregular heart.\" Other terms applied to the\ncondition have been \"ventricular rhythm,\" \"nodal rhythm\" and \"rhythm\nof auricular paralysis.\" The condition of the pulse has been\nLatinized as pulsus irregularis perpetuus.\n\nWhile the condition is best diagnosed by tracings taken\nsimultaneously of the apex beat, jugular and radial, still the\njugular tracing is almost conclusive in the absence of the auricular\nsystolic wave. The radial tracing is exceedingly suggestive, and if\nthere is also a careful auscultation of the heart, a presumptive\ndiagnosis may be made.\n\n\nOCCURRENCE\n\nThis condition of auricular fibrillation occurs occasionally in\nvalvular disease, and perhaps most frequently in mitral stenosis;\nbut it can occur without valvular lesions, and with any valvular\nlesion. If it occurs in younger patients, valvular disease is apt to\nbe a cause; if in older", "doc_id": "d2778437-bf88-470b-818e-40d3135aaec3", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a76b010cb23d06ccd401220e1d692ff7c156580a4013218a275a4a65e148bdc4", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 555895, "end": 559767}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "50687344-6faa-42ed-8cf3-fb60210d5a50", "3": "fe0c5311-7f9a-40a5-8c63-4cf3f66044b2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe0c5311-7f9a-40a5-8c63-4cf3f66044b2": {"__data__": {"text": "as pulsus irregularis perpetuus.\n\nWhile the condition is best diagnosed by tracings taken\nsimultaneously of the apex beat, jugular and radial, still the\njugular tracing is almost conclusive in the absence of the auricular\nsystolic wave.

If it occurs in younger patients, valvular disease is apt to\nbe a cause; if in older patients, sclerosis or myocardial\ndegeneration is generally present.\n\nIt may also follow infections such as diphtheria, or some infection\nwhich has caused a myocarditis. Rarely this fibrillation may be\ncaused by some of the drugs used to stimulate the heart.\n\nIt is astonishing how few symptoms may be present with auricular\nfibrillation and an absolutely irregular heart action. The patient\nmay be able to perform all of his duties, however strenuous, until\ncoincident, concomitant or causative ventricular weakening and\ndilatation of the ventricles or broken compensation occurs, and then\nthe symptoms are those due to the cardiac failure. Often in the\nfirst stage of this weakening and later fibrillation of the auricles\nthe patient may recognize the cardiac irregularity and disturbances.\nGenerally, however, he soon becomes accustomed to the sensations,\nand, unless he has cardiac pains or dyspnea, he becomes oblivious to\nthe irregularity. At other times he may be conscious of irregular,\nstrong throbs or pulsations of the heart, as such hearts often give\nan occasional extra sturdy ventricular contraction. These he notes.\nReal attacks of tachycardia may be superimposed on the condition.\nSooner or later, however, if the condition is not stopped, cardiac\nweakness and decompensation, with all the usual symptoms, occur. It\nseems to be probable that more than half of all cases of heart\nfailure are due to auricular fibrillation, or at least are\naggravated by it.\n\nAs previously stated, ventricular fibrillation is a very serious\ncondition, and may be a cause of sudden death in angina pectoris,\nand is probably then caused by disturbed circulation in one of the\ncoronary arteries causing an irregular blood supply to one or other\nof the ventricles. Absorption of some toxins or poisons which could\nact on the blood supply of the ventricles could also be a cause of\nthis condition. This irregular ventricular contraction sometimes\ndisplaces the apex beat.\n\n\nPATHOLOGY\n\nSchoenberg [Footnote: Schoenberg: Frankfurt. Ztschr. f. Pathol.,\n1909, ii, 4.] finds that in auricular fibrillation there are\ndefinite signs in the node, such as round cell infiltration, showing\ninflammation, a fibrosis of the tissue, and perhaps a sclerosis of\nthe blood vessels of that region. He also found that compression of\nthis nodal region of the auricle from some growth or other\ndisturbance in the mediastinal region could cause auricular\nfibrillation.\n\nJarisch [Footnote: Jarisch: Deutsch. Arch. f. klin. Med., 1914, cxv,\n376.] finds by personal investigations and by studying the\nliterature that the node showed pathologic disturbance in less than\nhalf the cases. Consequently, although a pathologic condition of the\nnode is a frequent, and perhaps the most frequent, cause of\nauricular fibrillation, other conditions, especially anything which\ndilates the right auricle, may cause it.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS\n\nIf the pulse is intermittent and there is apparently a heart block.\nStokes-Adams disease should be considered as possibly present, and\ndigitalis would be contraindicated", "doc_id": "fe0c5311-7f9a-40a5-8c63-4cf3f66044b2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "dfc378943acf30decb2e42273863fdaf121b870b48fde5406839ff487cead39f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 559846, "end": 563583}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "d2778437-bf88-470b-818e-40d3135aaec3", "3": "cbbeef03-30b4-4830-bf0f-84e0b93f68e6"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbbeef03-30b4-4830-bf0f-84e0b93f68e6": {"__data__": {"text": "the auricle from some growth or other\ndisturbance in the mediastinal region could cause auricular\nfibrillation.\n\nJarisch [Footnote: Jarisch: Deutsch.

Jour. Med. Sc., October, 1912.]\nof Philadelphia shows the diagnostic value of this drug. It is a\nfamiliar physiologic fact that stimulation of the vagi slows the\nheart or even stops it. Stimulation of these nerves by the electric\ncurrent, however, does not destroy the irritability of the heart;\nindeed, the heart may act by local stimulation after it has been\nstopped by pneumogastric stimulation. It is also a well known fact\nthat anything which inhibits or removes vagus control of the heart\nallows the heart to become more rapid, since these nerves act as a\ngovernor to the heart's contractions. Under the influence of atropin\nthe heart rate is increased by paralysis of the vagi. Talley states\nthat a hypodermic injection of from 1/50 to 1/25 grain of atropin\nproduces the same paralytic and rapid heart effect in man. He\nadvises the use of 1/25 grain of atropin in robust males, and 1/50\ngrain in females and in less robust males, and he has seen no\nserious trouble occur from such injections. The throat is of course\ndry, and the eyesight interfered with for a day or more, but Talley\nhas not seen even insomnia occur, to say nothing of nervous\nexcitation or delirium. Theoretically, however, before such atropin\ndosage, an idiosyncrasy against belladonna should be determined.\n\nThe value of such an injection rests on the fact that atropin thus\ninjected will increase the normal heart from thirty to forty beats a\nminute, and Talley believes that if the heart beat is increased only\ntwenty or less, if the patient has not been suffering from an\nexhausting disease, it shows \"a degenerative process in the cardiac\ntissue which makes the outlook for improvement under treatment\nunpromising.\" He also believes that when the heart in auricular\nfibrillation is increased the normal amount or more than normal, the\nprognosis is good. He still further advises in auricular\nfibrillation an injection of atropin before digitalis has been\nadministered, and another after digitalis is thoroughly acting.\nComparison of the findings after these two injections will determine\nwhich factor, vagal or cardiac tissue, is the greater in the\ncondition present. The patients with a large cardiac factor are the\nones who may be more improved by the digitalis treatment than those\nin whom the fibrillation is caused by vagus disturbance.\n\n\nPROGNOSIS\n\nThe prognosis depends on the condition of the myocardium of the\nvagus. If this muscle is intact, and there is no pathologic\ncondition in the sinus node (which can be proved by the successful\nresults of treatment), the removal of all toxins that could increase\nthe activity of the heart, and the administration of digitalis,\nwhich will slow the heart by stimulating the pneumogastric control\nof the heart, will produce a cure, temporary, if not permanent.\n\nAlthough a", "doc_id": "cbbeef03-30b4-4830-bf0f-84e0b93f68e6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cb0769028405c6f38b7471e054bf4e8a195d200478cc948b10573b054fcf2701", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 563533, "end": 567320}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "fe0c5311-7f9a-40a5-8c63-4cf3f66044b2", "3": "414317ed-3ed4-4eeb-b18d-d35c0983f9a9"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "414317ed-3ed4-4eeb-b18d-d35c0983f9a9": {"__data__": {"text": "determine\nwhich factor, vagal or cardiac tissue, is the greater in the\ncondition present.

In other words, auricular\nfibrillation added to these conditions is serious, but still, many\ntimes a patient may be greatly improved by rest, digitalis, careful\ndiet, proper care of the bowels, etc. If the fibrillation occurs\nwith or was apparently caused by the dilatation of the ventricles,\nthe prognosis of improvement may be good. If the dilatation of the\nventricles occurs following auricular fibrillation, the prognosis is\nnot good.\n\nWhite [Footnote: White: Boston Med. and Surg. Jour., Dec. 2, 1915.]\nafter studying 200 heart cases, finds that auricular fibrillation\nand alternating pulse, as well as heart block, are more frequent in\nmen than in women, and both auricular fibrillation and alternating\npulse are more apt to occur after 50 years of age than before.\nAuricular fibrillation may occur in hearts which are suffering from\nvalvular lesions, especially mitral stenosis, and may occur in\nsyphilitic hearts, in various sclerotic conditions of the heart, and\nin hyperthyroidism.\n\nThough disputed, it seems probable that fibrillation may be caused\nby the excessive use of tea, coffee and tobacco. Paroxysmal\ntachycardias are certainly caused by these substances, and the\nconditions of auricular fibrillation and auricular flutter may be\nfound frequently present if such hearts are carefully examined with\ncardiographic instruments.\n\n\nTREATMENT\n\nThe condition may be stopped by relieving the heart and circulation\nof all possible toxins and irritants, and by the administration of\ndigitalis. One attack is frequently followed by others, perhaps of\nlonger duration. Occasionally, however, the patient may be observed\nfor many years without the condition again being present.

It is\nwell to administer digitalis at first three times a day, then as\nsoon as its action is thoroughly established, reduce to twice a day,\nand later to once a day, in such dosage as is needed to make a\nprofound impression on the heart.

It should\nbe emphasized that the proper dose of digitalis is enough to do the\nwork. If within a few days there is no marked improvement, the\nprognosis is not good. Also, if the digitalis causes cardiac pain\nwhen such was not present, or increases cardiac pains already in\nevidence, and causes a tight feeling in the chest, nausea or\nvomiting, or a diminished amount of urine, and a tight, bandlike\nfeeling in the head, digitalis is not acting well, and should be\nstopped, or the dose is too large. Also, if there is kidney\ninsufficiency, or if the digitalis diminishes the output of urine,\nit generally should be stopped.\n\nIf the blood pressure is high, and perhaps almost always, even in\nthose who are accustomed to the use of it, tobacco should be\nstopped.

He found such a condition present In seventy-\none out of 300 patients examined, and he believes that if every\ndecompensating heart with arrhythmia was graphically examined, this\ncondition would be frequently found. The alternation may be\nconstant, or it may occur in phases.

White\n[Footnote: White: Am. Jour. Med. Sc., July, 1915, p. 82.] has shown\nthat this condition is not infrequent, as demonstrated by\npolygraphic tracings. He found such a condition present In seventy-\none out of 300 patients examined, and he believes that if every\ndecompensating heart with arrhythmia was graphically examined, this\ncondition would be frequently found. The alternation may be\nconstant, or it may occur in phases. It is due to a diminished\ncontractile power of the heart when the heart muscle has become\nweakened and a more or less rapid heart action is present.\n\nGordinier [Footnote: Gordinier: Am. Jour. Med.

He finds that it frequently occurs with\nCheyne-Stokes respiration, and continues until death. He also finds\nthat the condition is not uncommon in dilated hearts, especially in\nmitral disease, and with other symptoms of decompensation.\n\nWhite found that about half of his cases of pulsus alternans showed\nan increased blood pressure of 160 mm. or more; 62 percent. were in\npatients over 50 years of age, and 69 percent. were in men.\nNecropsics on patients who died of this condition showed coronary\nsclerosis and arteriosclerotic kidneys.\n\nThe onset of dyspnea, with a rapid pulse, should lead one to suspect\npulsus alternans when such a condition occurs in a person over 50\nwith cardiovascular-renal disease, arid with signs of\ndecompensation, and also when such a condition occurs with a patient\nwho has a history of angina pectoris.\n\nWhile the forcefulness of the varying beats of an alternating pulse\nmay be measured by blood pressure instruments by the auscultatory\nmethod, White and Lunt [Footnote: White, P. D. and Lunt, L. K.: The\nDetection of Pulsus Alternans, THE JOURNAL A. M.

A pulse below 58 or 60 beats per minute should be\nconsidered slow, and anything below 50 should be considered\nabnormally slow and a condition more or less suspicious. A pulse\nfrom 45 to 50 per minute occasionally occurs when no pathologic\nexcuse can be found, but such a slow rate is unusual. Before\ndetermining that the heart is slow, it must of course be carefully\nexamined to determine if there are beats which are not transmitted\nto the wrist; also whether a slow radial rate is not due to\nintermitence or a heart block.

Auricular fibrillation, while\ngenerally causing a rapid pulse (though by no means all beats are\ntransmitted to the peripheral arteries), tray cause a slow pulse\nbecause some of the contractions of the heart are not transmitted.\n\nWhile any pulse rate below 50 should be considered abnormal and more\nor less pathologic, still a pulse rate no lower than 60 may, be very\nabnormal for the individual. For athletes and those who work hard\nphysically, a slow pulse is normal. Such hearts are often not even\nnormally stimulated by high fever, so that the pulse is unusually\nslow, considering the patient's temperature, unless inflammation of\nthe heart has occurred.\n\nSome chronic diseases cause a slow pulse; this is especially true of\nchronic interstitial nephritis. In fact, it may be stated that any\ndisease or condition which increases the blood pressure generally\nslows the pulse, unless the heart itself is affected. This is true\nof hypertension, of arteriosclerosis, of nicotin unless the heart\nhas become injured, and often of caffein, unless it acts in the\nindividual as a nervous stimulant. Chronic lead poisoning causes a\nslow pulse on account of the increased blood pressure.\n\nA slow pulse may occur during convalescence from acute infections,\nsuch as typhoid fever and pneumonia, and sometimes after septic\nprocesses. While it may not be serious in these conditions, it\nshould always be carefully watched, as it may show a serious\nmyocarditis.\n\nWhile weakness generally and myocarditis, at least oil exertion or\nnervous excitation or after eating, cause a heart to be rapid, still\nsuch a heart may act sluggishly when the patient is at rest, so that\nhe feels faint and weak and disinclined to attempt even the\nslightest exertion. In such a condition calcium, iron and strychnin,\nnot too frequently or in too large doses, and perhaps caffein, are\nindicated. Camphor is always a valuable stimulant, more or less\nfrequently administered, during such a period of slow heart. This\nslow heart sometimes occurs after rheumatic fever; it is quite\nfrequent after diphtheria, and may show a disturbance of the vagi.\n\nAlthough the prognosis of such slow hearts after serious illness is\ngenerally good, a heart that is too rapid after illness is often\nmore readily brought to normal by proper management than a heart\nwhich is too slow. Either condition needs proper treatment and\nproper management.\n\nIt is well recognized that serious, almost major hysteria may be\npresent and the heart not only not be increased, but it may even be\nslowed. The heart in this condition of course requires no treatment.\nIn cerebral disturbances, especially when there is cerebral\npressure, and more particularly if there is pressure in the fourth\nventricle, the pulse may be much slowed. It is often slowed in\nconnection with Cheyne-Stokes respiration. It may be very slow after\napoplexy, and when there are brain tumors. It is often much slowed\nin narcotic poisoning, especially in opium, chloral and bromid\npoisoning. Serious toxemia from alcohol may cause a heart to be very\nslow.

Uremic\npoisoning and acidemia and coma of diabetes tray cause a pulse to be\nvery slow.\n\nNot infrequently after parturition the heart quiets down from its\nexertion to a rate below normal. If the urine is known to be free\nfrom albumin and casts, and there are no signs of impending\neclampsia, the slow pulse is indicative of no serious trouble; but\nthe urine should be carefully examined and a possible uremia or\nother cause of eclampsia carefully considered. Sometimes with\nserious edema and after serious hemorrhage the heart becomes very\nslow, unless some exertion is made, when it will beat more rapidly\nthan normal. This probably represents a diminished cardiac\nnutrition.\n\nThe cardiac lesions which cause a pulse to be slow are sclerosis or\nthrombosis of the coronary arteries, fatty degeneration of the\nmyocardium, and Stokes-Adams disease.\n\nIt is seen, therefore, that when a pulse is slower than normal, even\nbelow 65 beats per minute, the cause should be sought. If no\nfunctional or pathologic excuse is discovered, it must be considered\nnormal, for the individual, and, as stated above, even 58 or 60\nbeats per minute are in many instances normal for men. This is\nespecially true with beginning hypertension, and may be true in\nyoung men who are athletic or who are oversmoking but are not being\npoisoned by the nicotin, as shown by the fact that their hearts are\nnot rapid, that they are not having cardiac pains, that they do not\nperspire profusely, and that they do not have muscle cramps. A pulse\nof from 50 to 55 is likely to be seriously considered by an\ninsurance company in deciding the advisability of the risk, and\nbelow 50 must be considered as abnormal.\n\n\nSYMPTOMS\n\nIf a person has been long accustomed to a slow-acting heart, there\nare no symptoms. If the heart has become slowed from disease or from\nany acute condition, the patient is likely to feel more or less\nfaint, perhaps have some dizzines, and often headache, which is\ngenerally relieved by lying down. Sometimes convulsions may occur,\nepileptiform in character, due possibly to anemia or irritation of\nthe brain. If the slow heart does not cause these more serious\nsymptoms, the patient may feel week and unable to attend to his\nordinary duties. As previously urged an abnormally slow heart after\nserious illness should be as carefully cared for as a too rapid\nheart under the same conditions. Probably often a myocarditis and\nperhaps some fatty degeneration are at the base of such a slowed\nheart after serious infections.\n\nA heart which has not always been slow but has gradually become slow\nwith the progress of hypertension and arteriosclerosis will often\ndisclose on postmortem examination serious lesions of the coronary\narteries.\n\nDeficiency in the thyroid secretion will always cause a heart to be\nslower than normal.

Other patients who faint or have attacks of syncope should\nremain at rest on a couch or bed for some hours.\n\nA tangible cause, being discovered for an unusually slow heart is\nsufficiently indicative of the treatment not to require further\ncomment. While generally toxins from intestinal indigestion make a\nheart irritable and more rapid, sometimes they slow a heart, and in\nsuch cases the heart will be improved when catharsis has been caused\nand a modification of the diet is ordered.\n\n\nPAROXYSMAL TACHYCARDIA\n\nThis condition is generally termed by the patient a \"palpitation,\"\nand palpitation of the heart is recognized by most physicians as\nmeaning a too rapidly acting heart, the term \"tachycardia\" being\nreserved for an excessive rapidity of the heart. Many of the so-\ncalled tachycardias are really instances of auricular fibrillation\nor flutter. Some persons normally have a pulse and heart too rapid;\nchildren more or less constantly have a heart beat of from 90 to\n100. Women have more rapid heart action than men, and it becomes\nmore rapid with their varying functions, specifically increasing its\nrapidity before, and perhaps during, menstruation. Many patients\nhave a rapid heart action with the slightest increase in temperature\nand in any fever process. Some have a rapid heart action after the\nleast exertion without any cardiac lesion or assignable excuse for\nsuch rapidity. Others have a rapid heart with mental activity and\nexcessive excitement. Therefore in deciding that a heart is\nabnormally rapid one must individualize the patient.\n\nDuring or after illness many patients are said to have palpitation\nwhen the real cause is an unhealed myocarditis. Tuberculosis almost\ninvariably causes increased heart action, even when there is no\nfever. All high fever increases the heart's action, but not so\nmarkedly in typhoid fever as in other fevers; in fact, the heart in\ntyphoid fever, during the early stages, is apt to be slower than the\ntemperature would seem to call for. In anemia when the patient is\nactive the heart is generally rapid. The rapid heart from cardiac\ndisease has already been considered.

With proper\nmanagement the condition will improve unless the patient has an\nidiosyncrasy for intermittent attacks of slightly rapid heart, as\nfrom 100 to 120 beats per minute.\n\nA permanently rapid heart, when the patient has no heart lesion and\nis at rest, is generally due to hypersecretion of the thyroid, which\nwill be discussed later. Paroxysmal tachycardia is a name applied to\nvery rapid heart attacks in persons who are more or less subject to\ntheir recurrence. They may occur without any tangible excuse, and\nare liable to occur during serious illness, after a large meal,\nafter a cup of tea or coffee, or after taking alcohol. The heart may\nbeat as rapidly as from 150 to 200 times a minute, or even more,\nwith no other symptoms than a feeling of constriction or tightness\nin the chest, an inability to respire properly and a feeling of \"air\nhunger.\" The patient almost invariably must sit up, or at least have\nhis head raised. Attacks of cardiac delirium (often auricular\nfibrillation) may occur with serious lesions of the heart, as\nvalvular disease or sclerosis, but paroxysmal tachvcardia occurs in\ncertain persons without any tangible cardiac excuse. The auricles of\nthe heart may act more energetically than normal, and precede as\nusual the ventricular contraction; or the auricles and ventricles\nmay contract almost together--a so-called \"nodal\" type of\ncontraction. Rarely does a patient die of paroxysmal tachycardia.\nThe length of time the attack may last varies from a few minutes to\nan hour, or even for a day or more.\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nThere is no specific treatment for paroxysmal tachycardia. What is\nof value in one patient may be of no value in another; in fact,\ndrugs are rarely successful in ameliorating or preventing the\ncondition. Patients who are accustomed to these attacks often learn\nwhat particular position or management stops the attack.\n\nSometimes a patient rises and walks about. Sometimes an ice-bag over\nthe heart will stop the attack.\n\nIf there is no serious illness present, and no serious cardiac\ndisease causing the condition, and a patient is known to have an\noverloaded stomach or bowels, an emetic or a briskly acting\ncathartic is the best possible treatment. The attack often\nterminates as suddenly as it begins, without leaving any knowledge\nas to which particular treatment has been beneficial. A patient who\nis well and has an attack of tachycardia should be allowed to assume\nthe position which he finds to give him the most comfort, and to use\nthe means of stopping his attack which lie has found the most\nsuccessful. In the absence of his success or of his knowledge of any\nsuccessful treatment, a hypodermic injection of 1/6 or even 1/4\ngrain of morphin sulphate is often curative.

It should also be\nremembered that, if the patient is receiving digitalis in good\ndosage for broken compensation, tachycardia may be caused by an\noveraction of the digitalis. Such overaction would be indicated by\nprevious symptoms of nausea, vomiting, intestinal irritation, a\ndiminished amount of urine, headache and a tight, bandlike feeling\nin the head, cold hands and feet, and a day or two of very slow\npulse.

If the rapid heart\ncontinues until a myocarditis has developed and a weakening of the\nmuscle fibers occurs, or dilatation is imminent or has actually\noccurred, operative interference is serious, and most patients under\nthese conditions die after a complete operation, that is, the\nremoval of from one half to two thirds of the thyroid. In such cases\nthe only excusable operative interference is the graded one, namely,\nthe tying of first one artery and then another of the thyroid to\ninhibit the blood supply to the gland in order that it may not\nfurnish so much secretion. If the heart then improves, a more\nradical operation may be done without much serious danger. Therefore\nthe working rule should be that, if a heart does not quickly improve\nunder medical management, operative interference should not be\ndelayed until the heart has become degenerated.\n\nIf tachycardia is the only serious symptom present in a patient who\nis considered to have hyperthyroidism, it may generally be\nsuccessfully treated by insistence on quiet, cessation of all\nphysical and exciting mental activities, more or less complete rest,\nthe absolute interdiction of all tear coffee or other caffein-\nbearing preparations, total abstinence from alcohol, the restriction\nto a cereal and fruit diet (the withdrawal of all meat from the\ndiet), the administration of calcium, as the calcium glycerophospate\nin dose of 0.3 gm. (5 grains) in powder three times a day, and for a\ntime, perhaps, the administration of bromids. If the depressing\naction of bromids on the heart is counteracted by the coincident\nadministration of digitalis, they will act only for good by quieting\nthe nervous system and more or less inhibiting the secretion of the\nthyroid gland.\n\nIf a patient has exophthalmic goiter fully developed, absolute rest\nin bed, with the treatment outlined above, should soon cause\nimprovement. If it does not, the operative treatment as advised\nabove should be considered. If myocarditis has been diagnosed, the\nminor operations should be done if the patient does not soon\nimprove. The prolongation of the treatment depends on the condition\nand the amount of improvement.\n\nIf the physician is in doubt as to whether or not this particular\ntachycardia is caused by hyperthyroidism, the administration of\nsodium iodid in doses of 0.25 gm. (4 grains) three times a day will\nmake the diagnosis positive within a few days. If the trouble is due\nto hyperthyroidism, all of the symptoms will be aggravated; there\nwill be more palpitation, more nervousness, more restlessness, more\nsweating and more sleeplessness. In such cases the iodid should be\nstopped immediately, of course, and the proper treatment begun.\n\n\n\n\nTOXIC DISTURBANCES AND HEART RATE\n\n\nUnder this head it is not proposed to consider disturbances", "doc_id": "6a318dd3-65e3-4858-87e4-f89f4178862b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7ad2234168ad0e896a9611b1194fc9e9f14a32b35f92bd77013d1c06939116cc", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 597677, "end": 601591}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "6c2fed25-ed32-47a8-a204-0a2022ec7c26", "3": "55487a32-5e83-43f7-90e9-1f8cebcfad2d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "55487a32-5e83-43f7-90e9-1f8cebcfad2d": {"__data__": {"text": "of the treatment depends on the condition\nand the amount of improvement.\n\nIf the physician is in doubt as to whether or not this particular\ntachycardia is caused by hyperthyroidism, the administration of\nsodium iodid in doses of 0.25 gm.

In such cases the iodid should be\nstopped immediately, of course, and the proper treatment begun.\n\n\n\n\nTOXIC DISTURBANCES AND HEART RATE\n\n\nUnder this head it is not proposed to consider disturbances of the\nheart due to infections, to cardiac disease, or to localized or\ngeneral acute or chronic disease, but to discuss disturbances due to\nthe absorption of irritants froth the intestines, and to alcohol,\ntobacco and caffein.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to repeat that various toxins which may\nseriously irritate the heart may be absorbed from the intestines\nduring fermentation or putrefactives processes in either the small\nor the large intestines. The heart may be slowed by some, made rapid\nby others, and it is often made irregular. The relation of the\nabsorption of intestinal toxins to increased blood pressure has\nalready been described, and the necessity of removing from the diet\nanything which perpetuates or increases intestinal indigestion in\nall cases of high blood pressure has already been referred to\nseveral times. The indications that such a condition of the\nintestines is present are irregular action of the bowels, a large\namount of intestinal gas, sometimes watery stools, often a coated\ntongue, and the presence of indican in the urine.\n\n\nINTESTINAL PUTREFACTION\n\nThe most successful procedure in the management of intestinal\nputrefaction is to remove meat from the diet absolutely. Laxatives\nin some form are generally indicated, and one of tile best is agar-\nagar. Of course aloin and cascara are always good laxatives, with an\noccasional dose of calomel or saline, if such seem indicated. Some\nof the solid hydrogen peroxid-carrying preparations (magnesium\nperoxid, calcium peroxide [Footnote: See N. N. R., 1916, p. 232])\nhave been advised as bowel antiseptics, but they are not more\nsuccessful than many of the salicylic acid preparations,' and\nperhaps none is more efficient than salol (phenyl salicylate) in a\ndose of 0.3 gm. (5 grains), three or four times a day. Washing out\nthe colon with high injections is often of great value, but should\nnot be continued too long lest the rectum become habituated to\ndistention, and bowel movements not take place without an enema.\n\nLactic acid bacilli, best the Bulgarian, arc often of value in\nintestinal fermentation. A tablet may be eaten with a little lactose\nor a small lump of sucrose after each meal. Or yeast may be taken in\nthe forth of brewer's yeast, a tablespoonful in a glass of water,\ntwo or three times a day, or one sixth of an ordinary compressed\nyeast cake dissolved is a glass of `eater and taken once or twice a\nday. Or various forms of lactic acid fermented milk may be\nsuccessful.\n\nAny particular food which causes fermentation in the intestine of\nthe patient should be eliminated from his diet; the patient must be\nindividualized as to fruits, cereals and vegetables, Nit, as stated\nabove, meat should ordinarily be withheld for a time at least.\n\n\nALCOHOL\n\nEnough has already been said of the value and limitations of alcohol\nas a therapeutic agent.

As a beverage, when constantly used, it is\nliable to cause obesity, gastric indigestion, arteriosclerosis,\nmyocardial degeneration, chronic nephritis and cirrhosis of the\nliver. Its first action is undoubtedly as a food, if not too large\namounts are taken, and therefore it is a protector of other food,\nespecially of fat and starch. A habitue, then, especially if he has\nreached the age at which he normally adds weight, increases his\ntendency to obesity, and the first mistake in his nutrition is made.\nIf lie takes too much alcohol when he eats or afterward, his\ndigestion will be interfered with. Sooner or later, then, gastritis\nand stomach indigestion develop, with consequent intestinal\nindigestion. If lie takes strong alcohol, like whisky, oil an empty\nstomach, he may sooner or later cause serious disease of the mucous\nmembrane of the stomach, first chronic gastritis, and later atrophy\nof the glands of the stomach.\n\nAlcohol with meals which contain meat tends to the production of an\nincreased amount of uric acid. Alcohol taken before meals on an\nempty stomach causes sudden vasodilatation after absorption. It goes\nquickly to the liver, irritates it, and little by little causes\ncongestions of the liver, so that sooner or later sclerosis of this\norgan develops.\n\nAlcohol probably causes arteriosclerosis not by its action per se,\nbut indirectly by causing gastro-intestinal indigestion and\ninsufficiency of the liver, as a result of which more toxins\ncirculate in the blood, tending to produce arteriosclerosis. Sooner\nor later these irritants cause kidney irritation, and chronic\ninterstitial nephritis may develop. just which process becomes the\nfarthest advanced and finally kills the patient is an individual\nproposition and cannot be foretold. The finale may be cirrhosis of\nthe liver, uremia, arteriosclerosis, apoplexy or myocarditis with\ndilatation or coronary disease.\n\nWhile small, more or less undiluted closes of alcohol, as whisky or\nbrandy, may cause quick stimulation of the heart by reflex\nirritation of the esophagus and stomach, vasodilatation occurs as\nsoon as the alcohol is absorbed, and if large closes are absorbed,\nvasomotor paresis may occur, temporarily at least.\n\nDuring acute fever processes with an increased pulse rate, provided\nshock or collapse is not present, small or medium-sized doses of\nalcohol, by dilating the peripheral blood vessels and increasing the\nperipheral circulation, may relieve the tension of the heart and\nslow the pulse by the equalization of the circulation. Some of this\naction may be due to the narcotic effect of alcohol on the cerebrum.\nAlcohol may thus in many instances act for good. Overdoses, as shown\nby cerebral excitation, flushing of the face and increased pulse\nrate, will do harm; in fact, many a patient with a serious illness,\nas typhoid fever or pneumonia, is made delirious by alcohol.

Large\ndoses of alcohol in shock or collapse are contraindicated.\n\nChronic overuse of alcohol may cause chronic myocarditis and fatty\ndegeneration of the heart, with later weakening of the heart muscle\nand dilatation.\n\nIn acute alcohol poisoning the pulse may become very rapid and weak,\nand the patient may die of heart failure. This is often seen in\ndelirium tremens. The administration in this condition of enormous\ndoses of digitalis by the stomach is inexcusable, and the reason\nthat such patients survive such digitalis poisoning is that the\nstomach does not absorb during this cardiac prostration.\n\nA treatment as successful as any in this heart weakness in delirium\ntremens is morphin sulphate, 1/2 grain, and atropin, 1/15 grain,\ngiven hypodermically, with the administration of digitalis\nhypodermically for its later action on the heart. If the heart is\ncontracting very rapidly, an ice-bag over the precordia will often\nquiet it. If the pulse is very weak, the cerebral sedatives more\nfrequently used in delirium tremens, such as chloral, bromids,\nparaldehyd, etc., are generally contraindicated. A hot foot-bath and\nan ice-cap on the head sometimes aid in establishing a more general\nequalization of the circulation. It may often be necessary to\nadminister strychnin, although if the patient is greatly excited it\nshould be withheld as long as possible. For the same reason camphor,\ncoffee and other cardiac stimulants which cause cerebral excitation\nshould be withheld.\n\nIf the patient is in alcoholic coma, the pulse is generally slow,\nalthough it may be of low pressure unless the patient is otherwise\ndiseased. Caffein or coffee is here indicated, and the patient\nshould be kept warm lest he lose necessary heat. The stomach should\nbe emptied by an emetic, often best by apomorphin hypodermically,\nunless the pulse is excessively weak. Strychnin may also be given,\nand digitalis, hypodermically, if it seems indicated. Camphor is\nanother cardiac and cerebral stimulant that is valuable in these\ncases.\n\nThe treatment of an actual degeneration of the heart from overuse of\nalcohol is similar to the sane condition from other causes.\n\n\nCAFFEIN\n\nCaffein can irritate the heart and cause irregularity and\ntachycardia, especially in certain persons. In fact, some can never\ntake a single cup of coffee without having an attack of palpitation,\nand many times when coffee and tea have been unsuspected by the\npatient as the cause of cardiac irritability, their removal from the\ndiet has stopped the symptoms, and the heart has at once acted\nnormally.\n\nCaffein is a stimulant and tonic to the heart, increasing its\nrapidity and the strength of the contractions. It is also a cerebral\nstimulant, one of the most active that we possess among the drugs.\nIt increases the blood pressure, principally by stimulating the\nvasomotor center and by increasing the heart strength. It acts as a\ndiuretic, not only by increasing the circulatory force and blood\npressure, but also by acting directly on the kidney. This action on\nthe kidney contraindicates the use of caffein in any form, except in\nrare instances, when there is acute or chronic nephritis.

This action on\nthe kidney contraindicates the use of caffein in any form, except in\nrare instances, when there is acute or chronic nephritis. The\nincreased blood pressure caused by caffein also contraindicates its\nuse when there is hypertension. Caffein first accelerates the heart\nand later may slow it and strengthen it; but if the dose is large or\ntoo frequently repeated, the apex of the heart ceases to relax\nproperly and there is an interference with the contraction of the\nventricles, the heart muscle becomes irritable, and a tachycardia\nmay develop.\n\nTherefore when a heart has serious lesions, whether of the\nmyocardium or of the valves, with compensation only sufficient, the\naction of caffein in any form is contraindicated. The fact that it\nraises the blood pressure, thus increasing the force against which\nthe heart must act, and that it irritates the heart muscle to more\nsturdy or irregular contraction, indicates that a patient with a\nheart lesion or with a nervously irritable heart should never drink\ntea and coffee or take caffein in any beverage.\n\nMany patients cannot sleep for many hours after they have taken\ncoffee or tea, as the cerebral stimulation of caffein is projected\nfor hours after its ingestion. Caffein does not absorb so quickly\nand therefore does not act so quickly when taken in the form of tea\nand coffee as it does when taken as the drug or as a beverage which\ncontains the alkaloid. Persons who are nervously irritable, excited\nand overstimulated cerebrally, with or without high blood pressure,\nshould not take this cerebral and nervous excitant. This is true in\nearly childhood and in youth, and continues true as age advances, in\nmost persons. It is a crime to present caffein as a soda fountain\nbeverage to children and young persons when the excitement of the\nage is such as already to overstimulate all nervous systems and all\nhearts.\n\nA considerable majority of persons over 40 learn that they cannot\ndrink tea or coffee with their evening meal without finding it\ndifficult to sleep. Such patients, of course, should omit this\nstimulant. Some patients have already recognized this fact and its\ncause; others must be told. The majority of adults are probably no\nworse and may be distinctly benefited by the morning cup of coffee\nand the noon coffee or tea, provided the amount taken is not large.\nIt seems to be a fact that the drinking of coffee is on the\nincrease, especially as to frequency. Certainly the five o'clock\ntea, with women, is on the increase, and we must deal with one more\ncerebral and nervous excitant in our consideration of what we shall\ndo to slow this rapid age.\n\n\nTOBACCO\n\nIn spite of the fact that a large number of men today do not smoke,\nmore and more frequently every clinician has a patient who smokes\ntoo much.

If one is to judge\nby the internal revenue report it will appear that, in spite of the\npublic school instruction as to the physiologic action of tobacco\nand its harm, and in spite of the antitobacco leagues, the\nconsumption of tobacco is enormously on the increase.\n\nAlexander Lambert [Footnote: Lambert, Alexander: Med. Rec., New\nYork, Feb. 13, 1915] in studying periodic drinkers and alcoholics,\nfinds that most patients are suffering from chronic tobacco\npoisoning, and if they stop their smoking, their drinking sometimes\nceases automatically.\n\nHowat [Footnote: Howat: Am.

Int. Med., May, 1916, p. 659.] describes a\ncase of sino-auricular heart block due to tobacco poisoning.\nIntermittent claudication has been noted from the overuse of\ntobacco, as well as cramps in the muscles and of the legs.\n\nA long series of investigations of the action of tobacco on high\nschool boys and students of colleges seems to show that the age of\ngraduation of smokers is older than that of nonsmokers, and that\nsmokers require disciplinary measures more frequently than\nnonsmokers.\n\nSome years ago investigation was made by Torrence, of the Illinois\nState Reformatory, in which there were 278 boys between the ages of\n10 and 15 years. Ninety-two percent of these boys had the habit of\nsmoking cigaretes, and 85 percent were classed as cigarete fiends.\n\nThe most important action of nicotin is on the circulation. Except\nduring the stage when the person is becoming used to the tobacco\nhabit, in which stage the heart is weakened and the vasomotor\npressure lowered by his nausea and prostration, the blood pressure\nis almost always raised during the period of smoking.\n\nThe heart is frequently made more rapid and the blood pressure is\ncertainly raised in an ordinary smoker, while even a novice may get\nat first an increase, but soon he may become depressed and have a\nlowering of the pressure. While a moderate smoker may have an\nincrease of 10 mm. in blood pressure, an excessive smoker may show\nbut little change. Perhaps this is because his heart muscle has\nbecome weakened. If the person's blood pressure is high, the heart\nmay not increase in rapidity during smoking, and if he is nervous\nbeforehand and is calmed by his tobacco, the pulse will be slowed.\nIt has been shown that the blood pressure and pulse rate may be\naffected in persons sitting in a smoke-filled room, even though", "doc_id": "e1bc3cc2-91f5-4ddf-a9ac-9cdc4fdd4912", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "841107727fb1c09c2c8a8557eee2268e07fc48bba722c2b722544aa375346785", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 616469, "end": 620183}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "302b7eb6-8bb8-4760-8316-7e946425de9d", "3": "18b04a47-32ca-4a0c-9442-cc4bab78e660"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "18b04a47-32ca-4a0c-9442-cc4bab78e660": {"__data__": {"text": "blood pressure\nis almost always raised during the period of smoking.\n\nThe heart is frequently made more rapid and the blood pressure is\ncertainly raised in an ordinary smoker, while even a novice may get\nat first an increase, but soon he may become depressed and have a\nlowering of the pressure.

If the person's blood pressure is high, the heart\nmay not increase in rapidity during smoking, and if he is nervous\nbeforehand and is calmed by his tobacco, the pulse will be slowed.\nIt has been shown that the blood pressure and pulse rate may be\naffected in persons sitting in a smoke-filled room, even though they\nthemselves do not smoke. The length of time the increased pressure\ncontinues depends on the person, and it is this diminishing pressure\nthat causes many to take another smoke. The heart is slowed by the\naction of nicotin on the vagi, as these nerves are stimulated both\ncentrally and peripherally. An overdose of nicotin will paralyze the\nvagi. The heart action then becomes rapid and perhaps irregular. The\nheart muscle is first stimulated, and if too large a dose is taken,\nor too much in twenty-four hours, the muscle becomes depressed and\nperhaps debilitated. The consequence of such action on the heart\nmuscle, sooner or later, is a dilation of the left ventricle if the\noveruse of the tobacco is continued.\n\nThere is, then, no possible opportunity for any discussion as to the\naction of tobacco on the circulation. Its action is positive,\nconstantly occurs, and it is always to be considered. The only point\nat this issue is as to whether or not such an activity is of\nconsequence to the individual. The active principle of tobacco is\nnicotin, besides which it contains an aromatic camphor-like\nsubstance, cellulose, resins, sugar, etc. Other products developed\nduring combustion are carbon monoxid gas, a minute amount of prussic\nacid and in some varieties a considerable amount of furfurol, a\npoison. From any one cigar or cigaret but little nicotin is\nabsorbed, else the user would be poisoned. It is generally\nconsidered that the best tobacco comes from Cuba, and in the United\nStates from Virginia. While it has not been definitely shown that\nany stronger narcotic drug occurs in cigarets sold in this country,\nit still is of great interest to note that a user who becomes\nhabituated to one particular brand will generally have no other, and\nthe excessive cigaret-smoker will generally select the strongest\nbrand of cigarets. The same is almost equally true of cigar smokers.\n\nBesides the effect on the circulation, no one who uses tobacco can\ndeny that it has a soothing, narcotic effect. If it did not have\nthis quieting effect on the nervous system, the increased blood\npressure would stimulate the cerebrum. Following a large meal,\nespecially if alcohol has been taken, the blood vessels of the\nabdomen are more or less dilated by the digestion which is in\nprocess.

Or\nthe young boy, stimulated by his associates, smokes cigarets more\nand more frequently until he uses them to excess.\n\nJust what creates the intense desire for tobacco to the habitue has\nnot been quite decided, but probably it is a combination of the\nirritation in the throat, especially in inhalers; of the desire for\nthe rhythmic puffing which is a general cerebral and circulatory\nstimulant; for the increased vasomotor tension which many a patient\nfeels the need of; for the narcotic, sedative, quieting effect on\nhis brain or nerves; for the alluring comfort of watching the smoke\ncurl into the air or for the quiet, contented sociability of smoking\nwith associates. Probably all of these factors enter into the desire\nto continue the tobacco habit in those who smoke, so to speak,\nnormally.\n\nThe abnormal smokers, or those who use tobacco excessively, have a\nmore and more intense nervous desire or physical need of the\nnarcotic or the circulatory stimulant effect of the tobacco, and,\nconsequently, smoke more and more constantly. They are largely\ninhalers, and frequently cigaret fiends.\n\nIt is probable that tobacco smoked slowly and deliberately, when the\npatient is at rest, and when he is leading a lazy, inactive,\nnonhustling life, such as occurs in the warmer climates, is much\nless harmful than in our colder climates, where life is more active.\nSomething at least seems to demonstrate that cigaret smoking is more\nharmful in our climate than in the tropics.\n\nIt has been shown by athletic records and by physicians'\nexaminations of boys and young men in gymnasiums that perfect\ncirculation, perfect respiration and perfect normal growth of the\nchest are not compatible with the use of tobacco during the growing\nperiod. It is also known that tobacco, except possibly in minute\nquantities, prevents the full athletic power, circulatorily and\nmuscularly, of men who compete in any branch of athletics that\nrequires prolonged effort.\n\nThe chronic inflammation of the pharynx and subacute or chronic\nirritation of the lingual tonsil, causing the tickling, irritating,\ndry cough of inhalers of tobacco, is too well known, to need\ndescription.\n\nMany patients who oversmoke lose their appetites, have disturbances\nfrom inhibition of the gastric digestion, and may have an irregular\naction of the bowels from overstimulation of the intestines, since\nnicotin increases peristalsis.

These are the kind of patients who smoke while they\nare dressing in the morning, on the way to their meals, to and from\ntheir business, and not only before going to bed, but also after\nthey are in bed. It might be a question as to whether such patients\ndo not need conservators. The use of tobacco in that way is\nabsolutely inexcusable, if the patient is not mentally warped.\nCancer of the mouth caused by smoking, blindness from the overuse of\ntobacco, muscular trembling, tremors, muscle cramps and profuse\nperspiration of the hands and feet are all recognized as being\ncaused by tobacco poisoning, but such symptoms need not be further\ndescribed here.\n\nThe reason for which physicians most frequently must stop their\npatients from using tobacco, however, is that the heart itself has\nbecome affected by the nicotin action. The heart muscle is never\nstrengthened by nicotin, but is always weakened by excessive\nindulgence in nicotin, the nerves of the heart being probably\ndisturbed, if not actually injured. The positive symptoms of the\noveruse of tobacco on the heart are attacks of palpitation on\nexertion lasting perhaps but a short time, sharp, stinging pains in\nthe region of the heart, less firmness of the apex beat, perhaps\nirregularity of the heart, and cold hands and feet. Clammy\nperspiration frequently occurs, more especially on the hands. Before\nthe heart muscle actually weakens, the blood pressure has been\nincreased more or less constantly, perhaps permanently, until such\ntime as the left ventricle fails. The left ventricle from tobacco\nalone, without any other assignable cause, may become dilated and\nthe mitral valve become insufficient. Before the heart has been\ninjured to this extent the patient learns that he cannot lie on his\nleft side at night without discomfort, that exertion causes\npalpitation, and that he frequently has an irregularly acting heart\nand an irregular pulse. He may have cramps in his legs, leg-aches\nand cold hands and feet from an imperfect systemic circulation. In\nthis condition if tobacco is entirely stopped, and the patient put\non digitalis and given the usual careful advice as to eating,\ndrinking, exertion, exercise and rest, such a heart will generally\nimprove, acquire its normal tone, and the mitral valve become again\nsufficient, and to all intents and purposes the patient becomes\nwell.\n\nOn the other hand, a heart under the overuse of tobacco may show no\nsigns of disability, but its reserve energy is impaired and when a\nserious illness occurs, when an operation with the necessary\nanesthesia must be endured or when any other sudden strain is put on\nthis heart, it goes to pieces and fails more readily than a heart\nthat has not been so damaged.\n\nIf a patient does not show such cardiac weakness but has high\ntension, the danger of hypertension is increased by his use of\ntobacco, and certainly in hypertension tobacco should be prohibited.\nThe nicotin is doing two things for him that are serious: first, it\nis raising his blood pressure, and second, it will sooner or later\nweaken his heart, which may be weakened by the high blood pressure\nalone.

Such patients sometimes rapidly\nimprove when their previous circulatory weakness has been a subject\nof serious worry. Even such patients who were actually collapsed\nhave been saved by the use of tobacco.\n\nWhether the tobacco in a given patient shall be withdrawn\nabsolutely, or only modified in amount, depends entirely on the\nindividual case. As stated above, no rule can be laid down as to\nwhat is enough and what is too much. Theoretically, two or three\ncigars a day is moderate, and anything more than five cigars a day\nis excessive; even one cigar a day may be too much.\n\n\n\n\nMISCELLANEOUS DISTURBANCES\n\nSIMPLE HYPERTROPHY\n\n\nLike any other muscular tissue, the heart hypertrophies when it has\nmore work to do, provided this work is gradually increased and the\nheart is not strained by sudden exertion. To hypertrophy properly\nthe heart must go into training. This training is necessary in\nvalvular lesions after acute endocarditis or myocarditis, and is the\nreason that the return to work must be so carefully graduated. When\nthe heart is hypertrophied sufficiently and compensation is perfect,\na reserve power must be developed by such exercise as represented by\nthe Nauheim, Oertel or Schott methods. Anything that increases the\nperipheral resistance causes the left ventricle to hypertrophy.\nAnything that increases the resistance in the lungs causes the right\nventricle to hypertrophy. The right ventricle hypertrophy caused by\nmitral lesions has already been sufficiently discussed. The right\nventricle also hypertrophies in emphysema, after repeated or\nprolonged asthma attacks, perhaps generally in neglected pleurisies\nwith effusion, in certain kinds of tuberculosis, and whenever there\nis increased resistance in the lung tissue or in the chest cavity.\n\nThe term \"simple hypertrophy\" is generally restricted to hypertrophy\nof the left ventricle without any cardiac excuse--the hypertrophy by\nhypertension and hard physical labor. It is well recognized that it\nhypertrophies with hypertension and with chronic interstitial\nnephritis. It also becomes hypertrophied when the subject drinks\nlargely of liquid--water or beer--and overloads his blood vessels\nand increases the work the heart must do. This kind of hypertrophy\ndevelops slowly because the resistance in the circulation is gradual\nor intermittent. In athletes and in soldiers who are required to\nmarch long distances, hypertrophy generally occurs. This\nhypertrophy, if slowly developed by gradual, careful training, is\nnormal and compensatory. In effort too long sustained, especially in\nthose untrained in that kind of effort, and even in the trained if\nthe effort is too long continued, the left ventricle will become\ndilated and the usual symptoms of that condition occur. Such\ndilatation is always more or less serious. It may be completely\nrecovered from, and it may not be.

Therefore it proper understanding\nof the physics of the circulation by the medical trainer of young\nmen to decide whether or not one should compete in a prolonged\neffort, as a rowing race, for instance, is essential. It is wrong\nfor any young athlete to have an incurable condition occur from\ncompetition.\n\nSometimes simple hypertrophy of the left ventricle occurs from\nvarious kinds of conditions that increase the peripheral\ncirculation. It may occur from oversmoking, from the mertisc of\ncoffee aid tea, from certain kinds of physical labor, or from high\ntension mental work. It is a part of the story of hypertension. Many\ntimes such patients, as well as occasionally trained athletes, and\nsometimes patients with arteriosclerosis or chronic interstitial\nnephritis complain of unpleasant throbbing sensations of the heart\nadded to these sensations are a feeling of fulness in the head,\nflushing of the face, and possibly dizziness--all symptoms not only\nof hypertension but of too great cardiac activity. Various drugs\nused to stimulate the heart may cause this condition; when digitalis\nis given and is not indicated or is given in overdosage, these\nsymptoms occur.\n\nThe treatment is simply to lower the diet, cause catharsis, give hot\nbaths, stop the tobacco, tea and coffee, stop the drinking of large\namounts of liquid at any one time, and administer bromids and\nperhaps nitroglycerin, when all the symptoms of simple hypertrophy\nwill, temporarily at least, disappear.\n\nIf the heart is enlarged from hypertrophy, if it is the right\nventricle that is the most hypertrophied, the apex is not only\npushed to the left, but the beat may be rather diffuse, as the\nenlarged right ventricle will prevent the apex from acting close to\nthe surface of the chest. If the left ventricle is the most\nhypertrophied, the apex is also to the left, but the impact is very\ndecided and the aortic closure is accentuated.\n\n\nSIMPLE DILATATION\n\nThe term \"simple dilatation\" may be applied to the dilatation of one\nor both ventricles when there is no valvular lesion and when the\ncondition may not be called broken compensation. The compensation\nhas been sufficiently discussed. Dilatation of the heart occurs when\nthere is increased resistance to the outflow of the blood front the\nventricle, or when the ventricle is overfilled with blood and the\nmuscular wall is unable to compete with the increased work thrown on\nit. In other words, it may be weakened by myocarditis or fatty\ndegeneration; or it may be a normal heart that has sustained a\nstrain; or it may be a hypertrophied heart that has become weakened.\nHeart strain is of frequent occurrence. It occurs in young men from\nsevere athletic effort; it occurs in older persons from some severe\nmuscle strain, and it may even occur from so simple an effort as\nrapid walking by one who is otherwise diseased and whose heart is\nunable to sustain even this extra work.

All of the conditions which\nhave been enumerated as causing simple hypertrophy may have\ndilatation as a sequence.\n\nDegeneration and disturbance of the heart muscle and cardiac\ndilatation are found more and more frequently at an earlier age than\nsuch conditions should normally occur. Several factors are at work\nin causing this condition. In the first place, infants and children\nare now being saved though they may have inherited, or acquired, a\ndiminished withstanding power against disease and against the strain\nand vicissitudes of adult life. Other very important factors in\ncausing the varied fortes of cardiac disturbances are the rapidity\nand strenuousness of a business and social life, and competitive\nathletics in school and college, to say nothing of the oversmoking\nand excessive dancing of many.\n\nThe symptoms of heart strain, if the condition is acute, are those\nof complete prostration, lowered blood pressure, and a sluggishly,\ninsufficiently acting heart. The heart is found enlarged, the apex\nbeat diffuse and there may be a systolic blow at the mitral or\ntricuspid valve. Sometimes, although the patient recognizes that he\nhas hurt himself and strained his heart, he is not prostrated, and\nthe full symptoms do not occur for several hours or perhaps several\ndays, although the patient realizes that he is progressively growing\nweaker and more breathless.\n\nThe treatment of this acute or gradual dilatation is absolute rest,\nwith small doses of digitalis gradually but slowly increased, and\nwhen the proper dosage is decided on, administered at that dosage\nbut once a day. Cardiac stimulants should not be given, except when\nfaintness or syncope has occurred, and if strychnin is used, it\nshould be in small closes. The heart nay completely recover its\nusual powers, but subsequently it is more readily strained again by\nany thoughtless laborious effort. The patient must be warned as\ncarefully as though he had a valvular lesion and had recovered from\na broken compensation, and his life should be regulated accordingly,\nat least for some months. If he is young, and the heart completely\nand absolutely recovers, the force of the circulation may remain as\nstrong as ever.\n\nSometimes the heart strain is not so severe, and after a few hours\nof rest and quiet the patient regains complete cardiac power and is\napparently as well as ever; but for some time subsequently his heart\nmore easily suffers strain.\n\nChronic dilatation of the heart, However, perhaps not sufficient to\ncause edema, slowly and insidiously develops from persistent\nstrenuosity, or from the insidious irritations caused by absorbed\ntoxins due to intestinal indigestion.

The prolonged high temperature causes\nthe heart to beat more rapidly, while the toxins produced by the\nfever process cause muscle degeneration of the heart or a\nmyocarditis, and at the same time the nutrition of the heart becomes\nimpaired either by improper feeding or by the imperfect metabolism\nof the food given; hence the heart muscle becomes weakened, and\ncardiac failure or cardiac relaxation or dilatation occurs.\n\nThe specific germ of the disease, or the toxin elaborated by this\ngerm, may be especially depressant to the heart, as in diphtheria,\nor the germ may be particularly prone to locate in the heart, as in\nrheumatism and pneumonia. But all feverish processes, sooner or\nlater, if sufficiently prolonged, cause serious cardiac weakness and\nmore or less dilatation.\n\nJust exactly what changes take place in the muscle fibers of the\nheart in some of these fevers has not been decided. Whether an\nalbuminous or parenchymatous degeneration of the muscle fibers or a\nfatty degeneration occurs, whether there is a real myocarditis that\nalways precedes the dilatation, or whether the weakening and loss of\nmuscle fibers or a diminished power of the muscle fibers occurs\nwithout inflammation, dilatation of the heart is always a factor to\nbe considered, and frequently occurs in acute disease.\n\nWhile it is denied that acute dilatation can occur in a sound heart,\nat the latter end of a serious illness the heart is never sound, and\nacute dilatation can most readily occur, though fortunately it is\ngenerally preventable. When the dilatation occurs suddenly, as\nindicated by a fluttering heart, a low tension, rapid pulse, dyspnea\nand perhaps cyanosis with venous stasis in the capillaries, death is\nimminent, although such patients may be saved by proper aid. Even\nwhen the dilatation is slower, as evidenced by a gradually\nincreasing rapidity of the heart and a gradually lowering blood\npressure, and with more evidences of exhaustion, death may occur\nfrom such heart failure in spite of all", "doc_id": "f1f05945-6d47-491b-991a-096024b8fe81", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4e21997eec7b1e1bee8936c274ed54e30c3edd5b4e76878411100aaf8f1d44ab", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 646823, "end": 650541}, "relationships": {"1": "2256dcd5-1e9c-4c7d-92fa-0092045f1943", "2": "7e54bafe-0517-4ef0-9757-88dee595a101", "3": "c72e9206-8389-4b38-9828-c0346874a243"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c72e9206-8389-4b38-9828-c0346874a243": {"__data__": {"text": "it is denied that acute dilatation can occur in a sound heart,\nat the latter end of a serious illness the heart is never sound, and\nacute dilatation can most readily occur, though fortunately it is\ngenerally preventable.

Even\nwhen the dilatation is slower, as evidenced by a gradually\nincreasing rapidity of the heart and a gradually lowering blood\npressure, and with more evidences of exhaustion, death may occur\nfrom such heart failure in spite of all treatment.\n\nUnless a patient dies from accident, as from a hemorrhage, from\ncerebral pressure or from some organic lesion in acute disease, the\nphysician frequently feels that if he can hold the power and force\nof the circulation for several hours or days, the patient will\nrecover from the disease, for in most acute diseases the patient has\na good chance of recovery if his circulation will only hold out\nuntil the crisis has occurred or until the disease is ready to end\nby lysis. Therefore anything during the disease that tends to\nsustain, nourish, quiet and guard the heart means so much more\nchance of recovery, whatever else may or may not be done for the\ndisease itself.\n\nThe best treatment of dilatation of the heart in acute disease is\nits prevention, and to prevent it means to recognize the condition\nwhich can cause it. These are\n\n1. Prolonged high temperature. A short-lived temperature, even if\nhigh, is not serious. Prolonged temperature of even 103 F. or more\nis serious, and even that of 101 is serious if too long continued.\n\n2. Exertion and excitement. Every possible means should be\ninaugurated to prevent muscular exertion and strain of the patient\nwhile in bed. Proper help in lifting and turning the patient should\nbe employed, the bed-pan should be used, proper feeding methods\nshould be adopted, and friends should be excluded so that the\npatient may not be excited by conversation.\n\n3. Bad feeding. The diet should of course be sufficient, for the\npatient and proper for the disease, but any diet which causes a\nlarge amount of gas in the stomach, or tympanites, is harmful to the\npatient's circulation, to say nothing of any other harm, such as\nindigestion may do. All of the nutriments needed to keep the body in\nperfect condition should be given to a patient who is ill; in some\nmanner he should receive the proper amounts of iron, salt, calcium,\nstarch, protein, sugar and water.\n\n4. Intestinal sluggishness. This means not only that tympanites\nshould not be allowed, but also that necessary laxatives should be\ngiven. It would be wrong to prostrate a patient with frequent saline\npurgatives, but the bowels must move at least once every other day,\ngenerally better daily; and if the case is one of typhoid fever,\nthey should be moved by some carefully selected laxative, and after\nthe bowels have sufficiently moved, the diarrhea should be stopped\nby 1/10 grain of morphin, and the next day the bowels properly moved\nagain.\n\n5. Depressant drugs. In this age of cardiac failure, heart\ndepressants of all types, and especially the synthetic products,\nshould be given only with careful judgment, and, never frequently\nrepeated or long continued.\n\n6. Pain. This is one of the most serious depressants a heart has to\ncombat; acute pain must not be allowed, and prolonged subacute pain\nmust be stopped.

Nothing rests a heart or recuperates a heart more than\nsleep. Insomnia and acute disease make a combination which will wear\na heart out more quickly than any other combination. Sleep, then,\nmust be produced in the best, easiest and safest manner possible.\n\n8. A too speedy return to activity. The convalescence must be\nprolonged until the heart is able to sustain the work required of\nit.\n\nThe treatment of gradual dilatation in acute disease has been\nsufficiently discussed under the subject of acute myocarditis. The\ntreatment of acute dilatation is practically the same as the\ntreatment of shock plus whatever treatment must coincidently be\ngiven to a patient for the disease with which he is suffering. The\ntreatment of shock will be discussed under a separate heading.\n\n\nTHE HEART IN PNEUMONIA\n\nAs pneumonia heads the list of the causes of death in this country,\nand as the heart fails so quickly, sometimes almost in the beginning\nin pneumonia, a special discussion of the management of the heart in\nthis disease is justifiable.\n\nAcute lobar pneumonia may kill a patient in twenty-four or forty-\neight hours; lie may live for a week and die of heart failure or\ntoxemia, or he may live for several weeks and die of cardiac\nweakness. If he has double pneumonia be may die almost of\nsuffocation. It is today just as frequent to see a slowly developing\nand slowly resolving pneumonia as to see one of the sthenic type\nthat attacks one lobe with a rush, has a crisis in a seven, eight or\nnine days, and then a rapid resolution. In fact the asthenic type,\nin which different parts of the lung are involved but not\nnecessarily confined to or even equivalent to one lobe, is perhaps\nthe most frequent form of pneumonia.\n\nThe serious acute congestion of the lung in sthenic pneumonia in a\nfull-blooded, sturdy person with high tension pulse may be relieved\nby cardiac sedatives, vasodilators, brisk purging, or by the\nrelaxing effect of antipyretics. Venesection is often the best\ntreatment.\n\nWhen the sputum almost from the first is tinged with venous blood,\nor even when the sputum is very bloody, of the prune-juice variety,\nthe heart is in serious trouble, and the right ventricle has\ngenerally become weak and possibly dilated. The heart may have been\ndiseased and therefore is unable to overcome the pressure in the\nlungs during the congestion and consolidation.\n\nThere is a great difference in the belief of clinicians as to the\nbest treatment for this condition. It would seem to be a positive\nindication for digitalis, and good-sized doses of digitalis given\ncorrectly, provided always that the preparation of the drug used is\nactive, are good and, many times, efficient treatment. Small doses\nof strychnin may be of advantage, and camphor may be of value. In\nthe condition described, however, reliance should be placed on\ndigitalis. Later in the disease when the heart begins to fail,\nperhaps the cause is a myocarditis. In this condition digitalis\nwould not work so well and might do harm.

It is quite possible that\nthe difference between digitalis success and digitalis nonsuccess or\nharm may be as to whether or not a myocarditis is present.\n\nIf the expectoration is not of the prune-juice variety and is not\nmore than normally bloody, or in other words, typically pneumonic,\nand the heart begins to fail, especially if there is no great amount\nof consolidation, the left ventricle is in trouble as much as the\nright, if not more. In this case all of the means described above\nfor the prevention of any dilatation of the heart will be means of\npreventing dilatation from the pneumonia, if possible. The treatment\nadvisable for this gradually failing heart is camphor; strychnin in\nnot too large doses, at the most 1/10 grain hypodermically once in\nsix hours; often ergot intramuscularly once in six hours for two or\nthree doses and then once in twelve hours; plenty of fresh air, or\nperhaps the inhalation of oxygen. Oxygen does not cure pneumonia,\nbut may relieve a dyspnea and aid a heart until other drugs have\ntime to act.\n\nIf there is insomnia, morphin in small doses will not only cause\nsleep, but also not hurt the heart. In the morning hours of the day\nthe value of caffein as a cardiac stimulant and vasocontractor,\neither in the form of caffein or as black coffee, should be\nremembered. Strophanthin may be given intravenously.\n\nOne of the greatest cares in the treatment of heart failure in\npneumonia should be not to give too many drugs or to do too much.\n\n\nSHOCK\n\nThe treatment of shock will probably always be unsatisfactory as the\ncause is so varied, and, although circulatory prostration and\nvasomotor paresis always constitute the acute condition, the\nphysiologic health of the heart and blood vessels is so varied. The\npatient in shock has low temperature, low blood pressure, and a\npulse either rapid or slow, but excessively feeble; the face is\npale, the surface of the body cold, and there is more or less clammy\nperspiration; there may be dyspnea and cardiac anxiety, or the\npatient may hardly breathe.\n\nAn acute cause, as terrible pain or hemorrhage, must of course be\nstopped immediately. There is more or less anemia of the brain, and\ntherefore the legs and perhaps the lower part of the body should be\nelevated. It may even be wise to drive the blood from the legs by\nEsmarch bandages into the rest of the circulation. As there is\nalways more or less paresis and dilatation of the large veins of the\nsplanchnic system, a tight bandage about the abdomen is of great\nadvantage in raising the blood pressure to the safety mark.\n\nStrophanthin, given intravenously, is valuable as a quick\nrestorative of the heart. Digitalis is so slow that it is of little\nvalue in an emergency. Camphor hypodermically, and hot liquids\n(nothing is better than black coffee) given by the mouth, are\nvaluable remedies.

An aseptic preparation of ergot\ngiven intramuscularly is most efficient in raising the blood\npressure and aiding the heart. One dose of brandy or whisky may do\nno harm. Alcohol, however, should not be pushed.\n\nA most important procedure in all kinds of shock is to surround the\npatient with dry heat, hot-water bags, and hot flannels; gentle\nfriction of the arms and legs, unless the patient is too exhausted,\nmay be of benefit. A hot-water bag to the heart is always a\nstimulant. Sometimes friction over the base of the heart in the\nregion of the auricles is of benefit.\n\nIf the collapse is not acute and there is gradual profound\nprostration, or if the patient is improved but still in a serious\ncondition of shock, too energetic measures must not be used; neither\nshould too many drugs be administered, or drugs in too large doses.\nAbsolute quiet and the administration of liquid nourishment in but\nsmall amounts at a time are essential.\n\nThe hypodermic administration of epinephrin solutions, 1:10,000, or\nsolutions of pituitary extract, 1:10,000, should be considered; they\nare often valuable.\n\nIf the shock occurs in ether or chloroform anesthesia, the\nvasopressor stimulating effect of inhalations of carbon dioxid gas\nmay be considered, as advised by Henderson.\"\n\nIf the shock is due to hemorrhage and the hemorrhage has ceased, a\ntransfusion of physiologic saline solution is generally indicated.\nTransfusion of blood under the same conditions is still better.\nRarely is transfusion indicated in shock from other causes; it often\nadds to the difficulty rather than improves it. Occasionally if\nshock is decided to be due to a toxemia, the toxin may be diluted by\nthe withdrawal of a small amount of blood and the transfusion of an\nequal amount of saline solution.\n\n\nACUTE DILATATION OF THE STOMACH\n\nThis condition is not well understood, nor is its frequence known,\nbut not a few instances of shock are due to dilatation of this\norgan. The shock to the heart may be a reflex one through the\npneumogastric nerves.\n\nIt perhaps not infrequently occurs after abdominal operations and is\nmore or less serious, the symptoms being persistent vomiting, upper\nabdominal distention and collapse.

Physiol., February and April, 1909. not\ninfrequently small doses of dilute hydrochloric acid seem to aid the\npylorus to maintain its normal contraction, the regurgitation of\nbile does not take place, and the stomach may soon acquire a more\nnormal muscle tone. Not infrequently when a stomach is in this kind\nof trouble and all the foods are rejected, and yet the patient\nseriously needs nourishment, a warm, thin cereal, as oatmeal or\ngruel or something similar, may be retained. Such patients, as has\nbeen repeatedly stated, need starch as soon as possible, lest an\nacidosis develop.\n\nIn these vomiting and collapse cases the hypodermic administration\nof morphin and atropin will not only stop the vomiting, at least\ntemporarily, but will also give necessary rest. The dose of morphin\nneed not be large, and the atropin may prevent nausea from the drug.\n\n\nANESTHESIA IN HEART DISEASE\n\nWhile no physician likes to give an anesthetic to a patient who has\nvalvular disease of the heart, and no surgeon cares to operate on\nsuch a patient unless operation is absolutely necessary, still in\nvalvular disease with good compensation the prognosis of either\nether or chloroform narcosis is good.\n\nWhen there are evidences of chronic myocarditis or a history of\nbroken compensation and the borderline of compensation and\ndilatation is very narrow, or when there is arteriosclerosis, the\ndanger from an anesthetic and an operation is much greater; it may\nbe serious, in fact, and the decision must be made whether or not\nthe operation is absolutely necessary. Under any circumstances it is\nunderstood that the anesthetist must be an expert, as there can be\nno carelessness and nothing but the best of judgment in causing\nanesthesia when there is cardiac defect.\n\nThe anesthetic to select is a subject for careful decision, as one\ncannot assert which anesthetic is the best.\n\nWhile chloroform seems occasionally to cause a fatty degeneration of\nthe heart, or if given too rapidly at first may cause sudden death,\nespecially in cardiac weakness, ether has its disadvantages, owing\nto the increased tension (especially if there is likely to be much\nvalvular or cerebral excitement), and the greater amount of ether\nthat must be given, with the attendant danger to the kidneys, which\nmay have been disturbed from the cardiac conditions. Generally,\nhowever, the better method is perhaps to administer first chloroform\nto the point of producing sleep and then to change to ether, the\nfirst mild chloroform narcosis preventing the ether from causing\nacute stimulation, and ether being better for the operation, as it\nis more of a stimulant.

In 2020, heart disease caused 1 in 5 deaths. That\u2019s nearly 700,000 people. Coronary artery disease, the most common type of heart disease, caused about 380,000 of those deaths.\n\nWho does heart disease affect?\nHeart disease affects people from most ethnic backgrounds, regardless of sex. Heart disease is the No.1 cause of death in the U.S.\n\nHow does heart disease affect my body?\nWhen your heart isn\u2019t working well, it has trouble sending enough blood to your body. Your blood brings oxygen and nutrients to your body\u2019s organs, tissues and cells. If they can\u2019t get what they need, it\u2019s harder for them to function. In a way, your heart delivers the fuel that keeps your body\u2019s systems running.
